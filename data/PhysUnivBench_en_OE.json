    "answer": "Step 1\nMagnetic Dipole Moment and Torque\n\n(a) Magnetic Dipole Moment\nThe magnetic dipole moment ($\\vec{\\mu}$) of the coil is given by:\n$\\vec{\\mu}=N I \\vec{A}$\n- Number of turns ($N$) = 15\n- Current ($I$) = 0.5 A\n- Area of the triangular coil:\n$A=\\frac{1}{2} \\times base \\times height$\nSubstituting the values:\n$A=\\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.08\\ m\\times0.15\\ m = 0.006\\ m^{2}$\n- The area vector ($\\vec{A}$) is perpendicular to the plane of the triangle, and since the coil is in the $x - 0 - z$ plane, $\\vec{A}$ points along the $y - axis$:\n$\\vec{A}=A\\hat{j}=0.006\\hat{j}\\ m^{2}$\n- Substituting:\n$\\vec{\\mu}=N I \\vec{A}=15\\times0.5\\times0.006\\hat{j}=0.045\\hat{j}\\ A\\cdot m^{2}$\n\n(b) Torque Acting on the Coil\nThe torque ($\\vec{\\tau}$) on the coil is given by:\n$\\vec{\\tau}=\\vec{\\mu}\\times\\vec{B}$\nSubstitute:\n$\\vec{\\mu}=0.045\\hat{j}$, $\\vec{B}=3\\hat{i}+8\\hat{j}$\n- Compute the cross - product:\n$\\vec{\\tau}=(0.045\\hat{j})\\times(3\\hat{i}+8\\hat{j})$\nUsing vector cross - product rules:\n$\\hat{j}\\times\\hat{i}=-\\hat{k}$\n$\\hat{j}\\times\\hat{j}=0$\n$\\vec{\\tau}=0.045\\times3(-\\hat{k})+0.045\\times8\\times(0)=- 0.135\\hat{k}\\ N\\cdot m$\nExplanation:\n- In (a), we measured the magnetic moment which provides information regarding the strength of coil acting as a magnet.\n- In the case of (b), we established the torque produced on the coil. The torque as you know acts in such a way as to try and put the magnetic dipole moment 10 the magnetic field causing the coil to spin.\n\nStep 2\nForce on the Coil and Energy Considerations\n\n(c) Force on the Portion of the Coil Along the $x - Axis$\nThe force on a current element is given by:\n$\\vec{F}=I(\\vec{L}\\times\\vec{B})$\nFor the portion along the $x - axis$:\n- Length of the segment ($L_{x}$) = 0.08 m\n- The current flows along the $x - axis$ ($\\vec{L}$), so $\\vec{L}=0.08\\hat{i}$\nSubstitute:\n$\\vec{F}=0.5\\times(0.08\\hat{i})\\times(3\\hat{i}+8\\hat{j})$\n- Compute the cross - product:\n$\\hat{i}\\times\\hat{i}=0$\n$\\hat{i}\\times\\hat{j}=\\hat{k}$\n$\\vec{F}=0.5\\times0.08\\times8\\hat{k}=0.32\\hat{k}\\ N$\n\n(d) How the Coil Rotates and Energy at $90^{\\circ}$\n1. Rotation\n- The torque $-0.135\\hat{k}\\ N\\cdot m$ causes the coil to rotate around its hinge.\n- The rotation continues until the magnetic dipole moment ($\\vec{\\mu}$) aligns with the magnetic field ($\\vec{B}$).\n2. Orientation Energy\n- The potential energy ($U$) of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field is:\n$U =-\\vec{\\mu}\\cdot\\vec{B}$\nSubstitute:\n$\\vec{\\mu}=0.045\\hat{j}$, $\\vec{B}=3\\hat{i}+8\\hat{j}$\nCompute the dot product:\n$U=-0.045\\hat{j}\\cdot(3\\hat{i}+8\\hat{j})=-0.045\\times8=-0.36\\ J$\nAt $90^{\\circ}$ (when $\\vec{\\mu}$ is perpendicular to $\\vec{B}$):\n$U = 0$\nExplanation:\n- In (c), we erred on the side of determining the force which acts on a segment of the coil along the $x - direction$. This force partitions with the overall torque force.\n- In (d), we studied the rotational behaviour of the coil and determined its rotational kinetic energy at different positions. The coil simply turns into the direction of the field in order to minimize energy.\n\nAnswer\nFinal Answers:\n1. (a) Magnetic dipole moment: $\\vec{\\mu}=0.045\\hat{j}\\ A\\cdot m^{2}$\n2. (b) Torque: $\\vec{\\tau}=-0.135\\hat{k}\\ N\\cdot m$\n3. (c) Force: $\\vec{F}=0.32\\hat{k}\\ N$\n4. (d) Orientation energy:\n- At alignment: $U=-0.36\\ J$\n- At $90^{\\circ}$: $U = 0\\ J$"

Instead, it only has to lift the difference between the elevator's weight and the counterweight's weight because the counterweight helps offset the load.\nPower = Work done / Time\nTo determine the power delivered by the motor when the counterweight is present we need to first calculate the net force and work done.\nForces Involved:\nThe net force the motor needs to work against is the difference in the gravitational force (weight) of the elevator and the counterweight.\n$F_{net}=(m_{lift}-m_{counterweight})g$\n$F_{net}=(1,202 - 801)\\times9.8$\n$F_{net}=401\\times9.8$\n$F_{net}=3,929.8N$\nWork Done:\nThe motor lifts the elevator a vertical distance, so the total work done is:\n$W = F_{net}\\times d$\n$W = 3,929.8\\times40.0$\n$W = 157,192J$\nPower:\nPower is the rate at which work is done, so dividing the work by the time taken gives:\n$P=\\frac{W}{t}$\n$P=\\frac{157192}{60}$\n$P = 2,620W$\n\nStep 2\nb) Without Counterweight\nIf there's no counterweight, the motor has to lift the entire weight of the elevator and its load.

    "answer": "### Introduction and Overview of the Question\nThe task involves analyzing position - time graphs to understand motion. The first graph depicts the position of an object over time. Using this graph, we aim to:\n1. Describe the motion in terms of walking patterns (e.g., speeding up, slowing down, constant speed, standing still).\n2. Create corresponding velocity - time and acceleration - time graphs using calculations and proper formulas.\n\nExplanation:\nThe key to understanding motion using position - time graphs is to describe the motion, including changes in speed and acceleration, and construct corresponding velocity and acceleration graphs.\n\n### Analyzing Graph 2 (Position vs. Time)\n#### Observations:\n- The graph starts at the origin (0, 0), indicating the motion begins from rest.\n- The slope increases between 0 and 3 seconds, indicating speeding up.\n- The slope becomes constant from 3 to 6 seconds, indicating motion at a constant speed.\n\n#### Motion Description:\n- From 0 to 3 seconds: The person accelerates, moving away from the starting position.\n- From 3 to 6 seconds: The person moves at a constant speed.\n\nExplanation:\nThe graph shows two phases of motion: an initial phase where the object speeds up and a second phase where it moves at a steady speed. These phases indicate accelerating and constant motion.\n\n### Calculating Velocity and Acceleration\n#### Velocity Calculation:\nVelocity is determined using the formula $v=\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}$\nWhere:\n- $(\\Delta x)$ - change in position\n- $(\\Delta t)$ - change in time\n\n**For 0 - 3 seconds**:\n- Initial position ($t = 0$), position ($x = 0$ m)\n- Final position ($t = 3$ seconds), position ($x = 5$ m)\n$v=\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{5 - 0}{3-0}=\\frac{5}{3}\\text{ m/s}\\approx1.67\\text{ m/s}$\n\n**For 3 - 6 seconds**:\n- Position at ($t = 6$ seconds): ($x = 10$ m)\n- Position at ($t = 3$): ($x = 5$ m)\n$v=\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{10 - 5}{6 - 3}=\\frac{5}{3}\\text{ m/s}=1.67\\text{ m/s}$\n\n#### Acceleration Calculation:\nAcceleration is calculated using $a=\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}$\n\n**From 0 - 3 seconds**:\n- Initial velocity ($v_0 = 0$ m/s)\n- Final velocity ($v = 1.67$ m/s)\n$a=\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{1.67-0}{3 - 0}=\\frac{1.67}{3}\\text{ m/s}^2\\approx0.56\\text{ m/s}^2$\n\n**From 3 - 6 seconds**:\n- Velocity remains constant ($1.67$ m/s)\n$a=\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{1.67 - 1.67}{6 - 3}=0\\text{ m/s}^2$\n\nExplanation:\nThe velocity graph represents how speed changes over time, showing an increasing trend followed by a constant rate. The acceleration graph highlights the change in velocity: a non - zero value in the first phase and zero in the second phase.\n\n### Final Answer:\n1. **Position vs. Time Description**:\n   - From 0 to 3 seconds: The object is accelerating as the slope of the graph increases.\n   - From 3 to 6 seconds: The object moves at a constant speed as the slope becomes linear.\n2. **Velocity Calculations**:\n   - From 0 to 3 seconds: $v=\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{5}{3}\\approx1.67\\text{ m/s}$\n   - From 3 to 6 seconds: $v=\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{5}{3}=1.67\\text{ m/s}$\n3. **Acceleration Calculations**:\n   - From 0 to 3 seconds: $a=\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{1.67 - 0}{3}\\approx0.56\\text{ m/s}^2$\n   - From 3 to 6 seconds: $a=\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{1.67-1.67}{3}=0\\text{ m/s}^2$\n4. **Final Graph Interpretations**:\n   - **Position vs. Time Graph**: Curved from 0 - 3 seconds (accelerating), linear from 3 - 6 seconds (constant speed).\n   - **Velocity vs. Time Graph**: Linear increase from 0 - 3 seconds, constant at ($1.67\\text{ m/s}$) from 3 - 6 seconds.\n   - **Acceleration vs. Time Graph**: Constant at ($0.56\\text{ m/s}^2$) from 0 - 3 seconds, then zero from 3 - 6 seconds.\n\nThe graphs above represent the following:\n1. **Position vs. Time Graph**: Depicts the object's movement, accelerating from 0 to 3 seconds and then moving at a constant speed from 3 to 6 seconds.\n2. **Velocity vs. Time Graph**: Shows the linear increase in velocity from 0 to 3 seconds (acceleration phase) and a constant velocity from 3 to 6 seconds.\n3. **Acceleration vs. Time Graph**: Displays a constant acceleration of ($0.56\\text{ m/s}^2$) from 0 to 3 seconds, followed by zero acceleration from 3 to 6 seconds.\n![](images/65be687ce7f92796c5b6647510edb3e14668a335eb61a5160d0238bd50486bc1.jpg)\n![](images/6aed466939217aa04ba4a4fe44f3aa24714e2a61c5ac992c8710fcf5f6c61e6d.jpg)\n![](images/ca798d46db2b926afe51ec2337fc46aebab5f72db2cb1af9795bdb77549b4c96.jpg)"

    "question": "A water molecule consists of an oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms, as depicted. An oxygen atom has a mass of 16.0 unified mass units (u) and each hydrogen atom has a mass of 1.00 u. The hydrogen atoms are each at a distance of 96.0 pm ($10^{-12}$ m) from the oxygen atom, and are separated from one another by an angle of 104.5°. Find the center of mass of a water molecule.\n$m_O = 16.0\\ u$\n$m_H = 1.00\\ u$\nThe angle between the hydrogen - oxygen - hydrogen is 104.5°, and the angle between each hydrogen - oxygen bond and the x - axis is 52.25°. The distance between each hydrogen atom and the oxygen atom is 96.0 pm.\n<image>",
    "subtopic": "Mechanics",
    "language": "english",
    "difficulty": 4,
    "answer": "Step 1\nIntroduction:\nTo solve this problem, we hope to find the center of mass (COM) of the water molecule which is made up of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms.\n\nExplanation:\nThe oxygen atom is located in the coordinate origin and two hydrogen atoms are on the coordinate around the oxygen atom (96.0 pm)at angles of (104.5°) between the two hydrogen atoms. The masses of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms have been provided as (16.0 u) and (1.0 u) respectively. The center of mass is that point which must be adopted as representing the whole mass of the molecule. In particular, to add weights of the center of mass the coordinates of each atom and their mass and relative to a Cartesian system.\n\nStep 2\nThe process to find the centre of mass involves the following steps:\nStep 1: Understanding the Problem and Coordinate Setup\nWe place the oxygen atom ($m_O = 16.0$ u)at the origin, ($x_O,y_O$) = (0,0), and assign Cartesian coordinates to the two hydrogen atoms ($m_H = 1.0$ u):\n1. Hydrogen - 1 is located at a distance (r = 96.0 pm)and an angle of ($- 52.25^{\\circ}$) from the positive x - axis.\n2. Hydrogen - 2 is located at the same distance but at an angle of ($+ 52.25^{\\circ}$) from the positive x - axis.\nThese angles are derived from the fact that the bond angle between the two hydrogen atoms is ($104.5^{\\circ}$), which splits symmetrically as ($52.25^{\\circ}$) above and below the x - axis.\n\nStep 2: Calculating the Coordinates of the Hydrogen Atoms\nThe Cartesian coordinates of Hydrogen - 1 and Hydrogen - 2 can be computed using trigonometric relationships. For a point in polar form, (r, $\\theta$), the Cartesian coordinates are given by:\n$x=r\\cos(\\theta)$, $y = r\\sin(\\theta)$\n- For Hydrogen - 1:\n$x_1=r\\cos(-52.25^{\\circ})=96.0\\cdot\\cos(-52.25^{\\circ})$\n$y_1=r\\sin(-52.25^{\\circ})=96.0\\cdot\\sin(-52.25^{\\circ})$\n- For Hydrogen - 2:\n$x_2=r\\cos(52.25^{\\circ})=96.0\\cdot\\cos(52.25^{\\circ})$\n$y_2=r\\sin(52.25^{\\circ})=96.0\\cdot\\sin(52.25^{\\circ})$\nSince the cosine function is symmetric, ($\\cos(-\\theta)=\\cos(\\theta)$), and the sine function is antisymmetric, ($\\sin(-\\theta)=-\\sin(\\theta)$), we find:\n- ($x_1 = x_2=r\\cos(52.25^{\\circ})$)\n- ($y_1=-r\\sin(52.25^{\\circ})$ and ($y_2 = r\\sin(52.25^{\\circ})$)\n\nExplanation:\nStep 1: Understanding the Problem and Coordinate Setup\nHere we demonstrate our comprehension of the problem and the coordinate setting. We put the oxygen atom at coordinate (0,0) for convenience; thus the hydrogen atoms are located at equidistant points. This setup makes sure that the shape of the water molecule as well as the symmetry has been well portrayed as it calculates.\nStep 2: Finding the Coordinates of the Hydrogen Atoms\nTo do this work, the method of converting polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates is easier to work out the exact positions of the hydrogen atoms with reference to the oxygen atom.\n\nStep 3\nStep 3: Centre of Mass Formula\nThe centre of mass coordinates ($x_{cm},y_{cm}$) are calculated using:\n$x_{cm}=\\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}m_ix_i}{M}$, $y_{cm}=\\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}m_iy_i}{M}$\nHere:\n- ($m_O = 16.0$ u, ($x_O,y_O$) = (0,0))\n- ($m_H = 1.0$ u, ($x_1,y_1$)) and ($x_2,y_2$)\nThe total mass of the system is:\n$M=m_O + m_H+m_H=16.0 + 1.0+1.0 = 18.0$ u\nSubstituting the coordinates of each atom:\n1. For ($x_{cm}$):\n$x_{cm}=\\frac{m_Ox_O+m_Hx_1+m_Hx_2}{M}$\nSince ($x_O = 0$), this simplifies to:\n$x_{cm}=\\frac{m_Hx_1 + m_Hx_2}{M}$\nUsing ($x_1 = x_2=r\\cos(52.25^{\\circ})$), we get:\n$x_{cm}=\\frac{2m_Hr\\cos(52.25^{\\circ})}{M}$\n2. For ($y_{cm}$):\n$y_{cm}=\\frac{m_Oy_O+m_Hy_1+m_Hy_2}{M}$\nAgain, since ($y_O = 0$), this becomes:\n$y_{cm}=\\frac{m_Hy_1 + m_Hy_2}{M}$\nSubstituting ($y_1=-r\\sin(52.25^{\\circ})$ and ($y_2 = r\\sin(52.25^{\\circ})$), we find:\n$y_{cm}=\\frac{-m_Hr\\sin(52.25^{\\circ})+m_Hr\\sin(52.25^{\\circ})}{M}=0$\n\nStep 4: Final Computation\nUsing the value ($\\cos(52.25^{\\circ})\\approx0.6157$):\n$x_{cm}=\\frac{2\\times1.0\\times96.0\\times0.6157}{18.0}=\\frac{118.6}{18.0}\\approx6.59$ pm\nAnd for ($y_{cm}$), as calculated earlier:\n$y_{cm}=0$\nThus, the center of mass is located at:\n($x_{cm},y_{cm}$)=($6.59$ pm,0)\n\nExplanation:\nStep 3: Centre of Mass Formula\nThe centre of mass formula provides exactly the right measures of the mass and position of all atoms of a body. By evaluating these contributions and adding them up, one is able to compute for the position of the molecule as weighted average.\nStep 4: Final Computation\nSupposing the values and using the symmetry to simplify it brings the answer to the next concluding - level logical. The x - coordinate stands for the asymmetry resulting from the greater mass of oxygen atom, the y - coordinate equals zero because of two equivalent hydrogen atoms.\n\nAnswer\nConclusion:\nThe COM of the water molecule is diagonally slightly in the positive x direction if the y and z axes are the reference as Oxygen is heavier than the two hydrogen molecules. The final coordinates are approximately:\nThe center of mass of the satellite is located at the following coordinates: $x_{cm}=6.59$ pm and $y_{cm}=0$\nThis result corresponds to the structure of water by breaking up this globe into oxygen and two hydrogens with the center of gravity nearer to the oxygen slew but pushed away because the two hydrogen spheres are balanced thereby creating the spherical water molecule."

For the hanging mass, the force due to gravity is $mg$, and for the mass on the incline, the force along the incline is $mg\\sin\\theta$.\n   - Substituting $m = 5.00\\mathrm{kg}$, $g = 9.8\\mathrm{m/s}^2$, and $\\theta = 30^{\\circ}$ into $T = mg\\sin\\theta$.\n   - $T=5.00\\mathrm{kg}\\times9.8\\mathrm{m/s}^2\\times\\sin(30^{\\circ})=5.00\\times9.8\\times0.5 = 24.5\\mathrm{N}$.\n   - The spring - scale measures this tension, so $T = 24.5\\mathrm{N}$.\n\n**Answers**:\n- For the horizontal pulley system, the spring - scale reads $98.0\\mathrm{N}$.\n- For the vertical pulley system, the spring - scale reads $49.0\\mathrm{N}$.\n- For the inclined - plane system, the spring - scale reads $24.5\\mathrm{N}$."

    "answer": "Step 1\nSolutions:-\n\nPart (a): Calculate the Impulse\nImpulse is given by the area under the force - time graph, which represents the integral of force over time:\n$Impulse=\\int Fdt$\n\nLooking at the graph, we see that the force - time curve forms a roughly symmetric bell - shaped curve, peaking at 800N. The time interval for the impact ranges from 0 ms to 200 ms.\nStep 1: Approximate the Area\nThe graph can be approximated as a triangle because of its symmetric shape. The base of the triangle is 200 ms = 0.2 seconds, and the height is 800N.\nArea of a triangle:\n$Area=\\frac{1}{2}\\times base\\times height$\n$Area=\\frac{1}{2}\\times0.2\\ seconds\\times800N$\n$Area = 0.1\\times800$\n$Area = 80Ns$\n\nExplanation:\nSince the problem asks for the nearest 2Ns, the impulse is approximately 80Ns.\n\nStep 2\nPart (b): Calculate the Change in Velocity\nWe are given the mass of the ball,\n$m = 50grams=0.05kg$\n\nExplanation:\nThe change in velocity $\\Delta v$ is related to impulse $J$ by the equation: $J = m\\Delta v$\n\nUsing the impulse from part (a):\n$80Ns=0.05kg\\times\\Delta v$\n$\\Delta v=\\frac{80}{0.05}\\Delta v = 1600m/s$\n\nAnswer\nFinal Answers:\n(a) The impulse exerted by the racket on the ball is approximately 80Ns.\n(b) The ball's change in velocity is 1600m/s."

    "answer": "Step 1\nTo determine the density of the fluid in the left column, we use the principle of hydrostatic equilibrium.\nSince the U - tube is open to the atmosphere, the pressure at the same horizontal level inside the tube must be equal.\n\nStep - by - step Solution:\n1. Define the pressure at the horizontal interface:\nExplanation:\nAt the interface between the two fluids (bottom of the U - tube), the pressure exerted by the left column is equal to the pressure exerted by the right column.\n2. Pressure on the left side:\nThe height of the left column is $h_{left}=30\\ cm = 0.3\\ m$.\nExplanation:\nLet the density of the fluid in the left column be $(\\rho_{left})$.\nThe pressure due to the left fluid is:\n$P_{left}=\\rho_{left}gh_{left}$.\n\nStep 2\n3.

For $(y_1)$, $(\\omega = 2\\pi)$, so $(f = 1)$. For $(y_2)$, $(\\omega = 2\\pi)$, so $(f = 1)$ as well.\n- Wave Velocity: $(v = f\\lambda)$. For $(y_1)$, $(v=1\\times2 = 2)$. For $(y_2)$, $(v = 1\\times4=4)$.\n\nQuestion 3: Matching\n\nExplanation:\nThe graphs correspond to the visual representation of the given equations. You need to compare the given waveforms and identify the correct plot for each.\n- The superposition of $(y_1)$ and $(y_2)$ shows a pattern that is neither purely $(y_1)$ nor $(y_2)$ but a combination.\n- $(y_1)$ has a higher frequency compared to $(y_2)$, which has a lower frequency and a longer wavelength.\n\nStep 3\n\nFrom the descriptions, it seems:\n- Plot C corresponds to the superposition $(y_1 + y_2)$.\n- Plot A corresponds to $(y_1)$ since it shows a higher frequency.\n- Plot B corresponds to $(y_2)$ since it shows a lower frequency and longer wavelength.\n\nQuestion 4: Multiple Choice\n\nExplanation:\nThe question asks whether the superposition forms a simple harmonic oscillation.\nSimple harmonic oscillation is a repetitive movement back and forth through an equilibrium position in a sine or cosine pattern.\nBased on the graph (Plot C) of the superposition:\n- The pattern of the superposition is not a single sine or cosine wave, but it might have a repeating pattern that could resemble a combination of harmonic oscillations.\nSo, the best answer here would be:\n- Yes. The pattern clearly repeats regularly.\n\nAnswer\nThe correct expression for the superposition is $(y_1 + y_2)$. Both waves have an amplitude of 1, wavelengths of 2 and 4, frequencies of 1, and wave velocities of 2 and 4, respectively. Plot A corresponds to $(y_1)$, Plot B to $(y_2)$, and Plot C to the superposition. The superposition shows a regular repeating pattern, indicating simple harmonic oscillation."

I appreciate help with new answers unless my system is incorrect.\nIn this lab, you will need to be able to describe how multiple waves interact with each other. 1) This does not add too much mathematical complexity to the wave - equation (Eq. 2), and 2) It allows us to develop a closer approximation of real - life situations as well (e.g. interacting ripple patterns in a pond, music, atomic physics, etc.). Here you will explore the superposition of two waves, $y_1$ and $y_2$, where\n$$ y_1=\\sin(\\pi x - 2\\pi t)\\quad\\text{and}\\quad y_2=\\sin(\\frac{\\pi x}{2}+2\\pi t) $$\n1. **Multiple Choice (0.2 points)**\nWhich of the following expressions accurately describes how these two distinct waves will combine?

Note: since the equations above are given without units, the answers below will be without units. Reviewing equations 1 and 2 may help you answer these questions. Some answers may be used multiple times.\n- The amplitude of $y_1$ is $1$.\n- The amplitude of $y_2$ is $1$.\n- The wavelength of $y_1$:\n    - For a wave $y = A\\sin(kx-\\omega t)$, the wavelength $\\lambda=\\frac{2\\pi}{k}$.

    "answer": "**Explanation**:\nThe problem involves using both graphical and computational approaches to analyze the image formed by a concave - mirror. To solve it, we need to apply the mirror equation and the magnification equation.\nThe mirror equation is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{f}=\\frac{1}{d_{o}}+\\frac{1}{d_{i}} $$\nwhere:\n- $f$ is the focal length of the mirror.\n- $d_{o}$ is the object distance (distance from the object to the mirror).\n- $d_{i}$ is the image distance (distance from the image to the mirror).\nThe magnification ($m$) is given by:\n$$ m =-\\frac{d_{i}}{d_{o}}=\\frac{h_{i}}{h_{o}} $$\nwhere:\n- $h_{i}$ is the image height.\n- $h_{o}$ is the object height.\nSince the radius of curvature ($R$) is $40mm$ for the concave mirror, the focal length ($f$) is $\\frac{R}{2}$, which is $20mm$ (remember, for a concave mirror, the focal length is negative).\n**Given**:\n- $R=- 40mm$ (negative because the mirror is concave)\n- $f=\\frac{R}{2}=-20mm$\n- $d_{o}=60mm$\n- $h_{o}=20mm$\n\n2nd step\nNow, let's apply the mirror equation to find ($d_{i}$):\n$$ \\frac{1}{-20}=\\frac{1}{60}+\\frac{1}{d_{i}} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{i}}=\\frac{1}{-20}-\\frac{1}{60} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{i}}=\\frac{-3 - 1}{60} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{i}}=-\\frac{4}{60} $$\n$$ d_{i}=-\\frac{60}{4} $$\n$$ d_{i}=-15mm $$\n**Explanation**:\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is formed on the same side of the mirror as the object, which means it is a real image.\nNow, let's calculate the magnification ($m$):\n$$ m =-\\frac{d_{i}}{d_{o}} $$\n$$ m =-\\frac{-15}{60} $$\n$$ m=\\frac{15}{60} $$\n$$ m=\\frac{1}{4} $$\n**Explanation**:\nSince magnification is positive, the image is upright with respect to the object.

    "subtopic": "Electromagnetism and electrodynamics",
    "language": "english",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "answer": "The given diagram shows three charges, which have equal magnitudes and are arranged vertically. The issue we're trying to solve here is the direction of the net electric field at point X.\n\n**Explanation**:\nPrincipally, the electric field due to the point - charge is collapsing with the distance from it which is squared. Positive charge induces the field of electricity in such a way that it is always symmetrical to the charge with respect to the direction.\nTo find the net electric field at point X, we consider the contribution of each charge to the electric field at that point:\nPoint X will have the greatest effect on the charge which is closest to it, since the latter is at a very near distance.\nThe second charge will contribute to a smaller force because of it's located further to the first.\nThe charged particle situated at the closest point to the proton will feel the strongest force; the one at the next point will feel a weaker force; and so on, with the charge that is the farthest away from the proton feeling its effect the most weakly.\nSince charges have the positive sign and their electric - field vectors are pointed along their direction (away from positive charges), the electric field at point X due to every charge will direct to the right. Here, despite differing distances, each field would be proportional varying in the sizes.\nAt point X, the net point - charge electric field will be the vector addition of the fields due to each charge. In this case all the such fields are the same and they converge in one direction i.e. to the right. However the force of the net field will be less than 3 times the field of the nearest charge which suffers from the inverse - square law's effect.\nLacking in numerical values, we can not calculate the value of the net electric field, but an industrial person can provide assure that the direction will be to the right, conforming the principle of superposition for the electric fields.\n\n**Answer**\nthe final answer is :\nthat the direction will be to the right"

    "answer": "---\n1. **Step 1**\n    - **Introduction**\nElectric flux, an essential electromagnetism concept, is used to calculate the number of electric - lines of force passing through surfaces. It tells us about the interaction of electric fields and objects and its surfaces nearby. Knowledge of electric flux is necessary for the analysis of various physical scenarios in which impinging electric fields interact with the shapes and materials. This is why we are probing the behavior of electric flux around a prism - shaped object array in a uniform electric field so as to calculate the electric flux through each of its surfaces by using the orientation of the surfaces.\n    - **Explanation**\nIn the given context, the electric field is directed along the x - direction with a strength of 700 N/C. There are quite a few faces of the prism, each oriented differently relative to the electric field. As such, it is fairly easy to deduce from the orientation of any surface whether any electric - field lines pass through them and to subsequently calculate the electric flux. Now the whole storyline is therefore titled about the relationship between the direction of the electric field and the normal phenomena of the surfaces, which it perceives, resulting in the so - called quantum of flux available to any given surface at any given time.\n2. **Step 2**\n    - Electric flux ($\\varPhi$) is a measure of the number of electric - field lines passing through a surface. The electric flux through a surface is calculated using the formula:\n$\\varPhi=\\vec{E}\\cdot\\vec{A}=EA\\cos\\theta$\nwhere:\n    - $\\vec{E}$ is the electric - field vector,\n    - $\\vec{A}$ is the area vector of the surface,\n    - $\\theta$ is the angle between the electric field and the surface normal.\nThe problem involves a prism - shaped object in a uniform electric field of 700N/C, directed along the x - axis. We calculate the electric flux through each specified surface based on their orientation and dimensions.\n    - **Explanation on Surfaces**\n        - **Surface I (Back Surface)**:\n            - Surface I is perpendicular to the y - axis.\n            - Since the electric field is parallel to the x - axis, it makes a 90° angle with the surface normal.\n            - $\\cos90^{\\circ}=0$, so no electric - field lines pass through this surface.\n$\\varPhi_{I}=EA\\cos\\theta = 700\\cdot A\\cdot\\cos90^{\\circ}=0$\n$\\varPhi_{I}=0\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C}$.\n        - **Surface II (Bottom Surface)**:\n            - Surface II is parallel to the xz - plane.\n            - The electric field is along the x - axis, so it is parallel to the surface.\n            - $\\cos90^{\\circ}=0$, so no electric - field lines pass through this surface.\n$\\varPhi_{II}=EA\\cos\\theta = 700\\cdot A\\cdot\\cos90^{\\circ}=0$\n$\\varPhi_{II}=0\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C}$.\n        - **Surface III (Left End)**:\n            - Surface III is perpendicular to the x - axis.\n            - The area of this surface is: $A = h\\cdot d=(40.0cm)\\cdot(30.0cm)=0.4\\times0.3 = 0.12m^{2}$.\n            - The electric field passes into the surface (negative flux direction).\n$\\varPhi_{III}=EA\\cos\\theta = 700\\cdot0.12\\cdot\\cos180^{\\circ}=- 700\\cdot0.12=-84\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C}$.\n        - **Surface IV (Right End)**:\n            - Surface IV is also perpendicular to the x - axis but faces outward.\n            - The area of this surface is the same as Surface III: $A = 0.12m^{2}$.\n            - The electric field exits the surface (positive flux direction).\n$\\varPhi_{IV}=EA\\cos\\theta = 700\\cdot0.12\\cdot\\cos0^{\\circ}=700\\cdot0.12 = 84\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C}$.\n    - **Explanation**\nIn the assignment to determine the electric flux for each surface, the first step was to find horizons about each face of the prism with respect to the direction of the electric field. The electric - field lines cross the surfaces that are parallel to the electric field will be such that the angle between the surface normal and the electric field exactly 90 degrees so they would not have any electric flux across such surfaces. Alternatively, those surfaces, which are completely at right angles to the electric field lines, will receive maximum flux, irrespective of whether the field is entering or leaving, depending on the direction of the orientation. By considering the alignment of every surface against the electric field, a precise description of the electric flux of each of the surfaces is achieved.\n\n3. **Answer**\nIn conclusion, the electric flux across the four surfaces of the prism is like this; the flux of the first surface (Back) is $0\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C}$, and the second surface (Bottom) has zero flux too; these two surfaces present the entire prism with inclination toward the electric field. The third one (Left) is perpendicular in orientation and faces inward; hence it has an electric flux of $- 84\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C}$, depicting the entry of electric - field lines. And the fourth (right) end changing the angle produces an electric flux of $84\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C}$ owing to the electric - field lines away from the end. These findings underline the symmetry of the electric flux within a uniform electric field and confirm that the net flux across the closed prism is 0, agreeing with Gauss's Law."

The free - body diagram shown here is a \"top view\" so it illustrates the forces acting on the box which are parallel to that surface. In other words, the normal force exerted by the surface on the box and the gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the box are perpendicular to the page and not shown. Use this diagram for Questions #2 - 6.\n2. If you observe the box to be completely stationary, there must be a fourth force acting on the box which is not shown in the diagram.

    "answer": "**Step 1**\nExplanation:\nAnalyzing the forces given in the diagram\nThe forces acting on the box are:\n$F_1$ acts horizontally to the left ($-\\hat{x}$ direction), $F_2$ acts at an angle in the top - right quadrant (has both $\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{y}$ components) and $F_3$ acts at an angle in the bottom - right quadrant (has both $\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{y}$ components).\nSince, the box is stationary, the net force acting on it must be zero, i.e\n$\\vec{F}_{net}=\\vec{F}_1+\\vec{F}_2+\\vec{F}_3+\\vec{F}_4 = 0$\nHere, $F_4$ is the missing force that need to be determined.\n\n**Step 2**\nExplanation:\nResolving the forces into components and writing the net - force equation\nBy using the diagram given in question we can resolve the forces as:\n- $F_1$ acts only in the $-\\hat{x}$ direction, hence the components are $F_{1x}=-\\vert F_1\\vert$, $F_{1y} = 0$\n- $F_2$ makes an angle $\\theta_2$ (assume) with the horizontal, hence the components are $F_{2x}=\\vert F_2\\vert\\cos\\theta_2$, $F_{2y}=\\vert F_2\\vert\\sin\\theta_2$\n- $F_3$ makes an angle $\\theta_3$ (assume) with the horizontal, below the $x$ - axis, so the components are $F_{3x}=\\vert F_3\\vert\\cos\\theta_3$, $F_{3y}=-\\vert F_3\\vert\\sin\\theta_3$\nFor equilibrium ($\\vec{F}_{net}=0$):\n1. Net force in the $\\hat{x}$ direction:\n$F_{1x}+F_{2x}+F_{3x}+F_{4x}=0$\n2. Net force in the $\\hat{y}$ direction:\n$F_{1y}+F_{2y}+F_{3y}+F_{4y}=0$\nSubstituting the known components:\n$-F_1 + F_2\\cos\\theta_2+F_3\\cos\\theta_3+F_{4x}=0$\n$0 + F_2\\sin\\theta_2 - F_3\\sin\\theta_3+F_{4y}=0$\nUpon solving these equations, we get\n$F_{4x}=F_1 - F_2\\cos\\theta_2 - F_3\\cos\\theta_3$\n$F_{4y}=-F_2\\sin\\theta_2 + F_3\\sin\\theta_3$\nThe magnitude of $F_4$ is\n$F_4=\\sqrt{F_{4x}^2 + F_{4y}^2}$\nThe angle of $F_4$ (relative to the horizontal) is\n$\\theta_4=\\tan^{- 1}(\\frac{F_{4y}}{F_{4x}})$\n\n**Step 3**\nExplanation:\nAdding the $\\vec{F}_4$ to the diagram\nDraw $\\vec{F}_4$ as a vector starting from the box, pointing in the direction determined by $\\theta_4$, with magnitude $F_4$. It should balance the forces $F_1$, $F_2$ and $F_3$.\n\n**Step 4**\nExplanation:\nAnalyzing the effect of the net force and writing the net - force equation\nCalculation of the net force by force by summing the contributions from $F_1$, $F_2$, and $F_3$ in both the $\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{y}$ directions.\nTherefore,\n$F_{net,x}=-F_1 + F_2\\cos\\theta_2+F_3\\cos\\theta_3$\n$F_{net,y}=F_2\\sin\\theta_2 - F_3\\sin\\theta_3$\n$\\vec{F}_{net}=F_{net,x}\\hat{x}+F_{net,y}\\hat{y}$\nNow, analyzing the effect of the net force,\nIf the net force is zero, the box will move with constant velocity in the $-\\hat{x}$ direction (as per Newton's first law). The motion is unaffected by the forces since they cancel each other.\nIf the net force is not zero, the box will experience an acceleration ($\\vec{a}=\\frac{\\vec{F}_{net}}{m}$). The acceleration will have components in the $\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{y}$ directions.\n\n**Step 5**\nExplanation:\nDescribing the future motion of the box and the final trajectory\nThe initial velocity of the box is in the $-\\hat{x}$ direction. The force components in the $\\hat{x}$ direction ($F_{net,x}$) will either slow it down, speed it up, or change its direction depending on the sign and magnitude of $F_{net,x}$.\nIf $F_{net,y}\\neq0$, the box will acquire velocity in the $\\hat{y}$ direction over time. This will cause the box to move in a curved trajectory rather than a straight line.\nThe components of the acceleration are:\n$a_x=\\frac{F_{net,x}}{m}$, $a_y=\\frac{F_{net,y}}{m}$\nThe velocity and position of the box evolve as:\n$v_x = v_{0x}+a_x t$, $v_y = v_{0y}+a_y t$\nand the displacement: $x(t)=x_0 + v_{0x}t+\\frac{1}{2}a_x t^2$, $y(t)=y_0 + v_{0y}t+\\frac{1}{2}a_y t^2$\nThe trajectory of the box will depend on the relative magnitudes and directions of $a_x$ and $a_y$. If $F_{net,x}$ and $F_{net,y}$ are nonzero, the box will follow a curved path.\nIf the net force in one direction is zero, the box will maintain its velocity in that direction.\nIf the net force in both directions is zero, the box will continue moving at constant velocity in the $-\\hat{x}$ direction.\n\nAnswer\nThe answers of both the questions had been described.\n![](images/6294db13d93da12418d83604c1693e1a4e2381fe5bd7cb7059c5560a3aa25061.jpg)"

    "answer": "Step 1\n\nPart (a): Determining tension in the slanted cable\n\nThe following is presented to us:\n- Weight of the hanging object: $W = 48,\\text{N}$\n- Angle of the slanted cable: $\\theta=35^{\\circ}$\n\nThe tension in the slanted cable $T_{slant}$ can be found using vertical force equilibrium. The vertical component of the tension in the slanting cable counteracts the weight of the object.\n\nForce Balance in the Vertical Direction:\n$T_{slant}\\sin\\theta = W$\nThis means:\n$T_{slant}=\\frac{W}{\\sin\\theta}$\nHence,\n$T_{slant}=\\frac{48}{\\sin35^{\\circ}}$\n\nLet's substitute the calculated value of $\\sin35\\approx0.5736$\n$T_{slant}=\\frac{48}{0.5736}=83.7,\\text{N}$\n\nExplanation:\nThere is a 48 N weight that is suspended by two cables, one at an angle of $35^{\\circ}$ and the other horizontal. We will need to analyze the forces acted on that system as we look to solve for the tensions in these cables. The slanted cable serves two purposes; it provides a vertical support to balance the weight and a horizontal pull to counter - balance the tension in the horizontal cable. With an understanding of how forces can be split into vertical and horizontal components, we can determine the necessary tension in each cable to maintain equilibrium.\n\nStep 2\n\nPart (b): Determine tension in the horizontal cable\n\nThe horizontal component of tension in the slanted cable is equaled by tension of the horizontal cable $T_{horizontal}$\n\nForce Balance in the Horizontal Direction:\n$T_{horizontal}=T_{slant}\\cos\\theta$\nSubstituting the specific values, we get:\n$T_{horizontal}=83.7\\cdot\\cos35^{\\circ}$\nSo, we need to calculate the $\\cos$ of 35:\n$T_{horizontal}=83.7 - 0.8192\\approx68.5,\\text{N}$\n\nExplanation:\nThe slanted cable provides the most support through its vertical component which means that its tension must be greater than the weight of the object because part of its tension is directed upwards. The horizontal cable is positioned to counteract the angled cable's tension. The horizontal cable is capable of tension but is weaker than the horizontal pull of the slanted cable. Because the slanted cable is pulling at an angle, the resultant Horizontal cable tension will also need to less than the slanted Cable tension. Together, these tensions will ensure that the weight will be held still without overturning the structure.\n\nAnswer\n\n(a) Tension in the slanted cable: 83.7N\n(b) Tension in the horizontal cable: 68.5N"

Segment AB: Linear expansion (variable pressure, increasing volume).\n2. Segment BC: Isobaric process (constant pressure, increasing volume).\n3. Segment CD: Linear compression (variable pressure, decreasing volume).\n4. Segment DA: Isochoric process (constant volume, no work done).\n\nStep 3: Calculate work done in all the given segments\nWork for segment AB:\n- In this case, the increase in V and P resumes for a linear trend, making it a triangular region under the curve.\n- Formula for triangular area: $W_{AB}=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot(Base)\\cdot(Height)$\nHere:\n- Base $(\\Delta V)=10\\ m^{3}$, where $20 - 10\\ m^{3}$\n- Height $(\\Delta P)=100 - 50\\ kPa$\n$W_{AB}=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot10\\cdot50 = 250\\ kJ$\n\nStep 2\nWork for segment BC:\n- This part is then a linear decreasing of (P) and increasing of (V) with a triangular area under the curve (negative work). $W_{BC}=P\\cdot\\Delta V$\nHere:\n- Pressure $(P)=150\\ kPa$,\n- Volume change $(\\Delta V)=50 - 20 = 30\\ m^{3}$.\n$W_{BC}=150\\cdot30 = 4500\\ kJ$\nWork for segment CD:\nThis is a linear decrease in both P and V, and so, here, we talk about a triangular area under the curve (negative work as the volume decreases).\nFormula: $W_{CD}=-\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot(Base)\\cdot(Height)$\nHere:\n- Base $(\\Delta V)=50 - 20 = 30\\ m^{3}$\n- Height $(\\Delta P)=150 - 100\\ kPa$\n$W_{CD}=-\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot30\\cdot50=-750\\ kJ$\nWork for segment DA:\n- This is an isochoric process $(\\Delta V = 0)$, so: $W_{DA}=0\\ kJ$\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total work done\nThe total work done is the sum of the work for all segments:\n- $W_{total}=W_{AB}+W_{BC}+W_{CD}+W_{DA}$\nSubstitute the values:\n- $W_{total}=250 + 4500-750 + 0=4000\\ kJ$\n\nStep 5: Verify the answer\nFor option A, we have found that the total work done in the process ABCD is $+ 4500\\ kJ$.\n\nAnswer\nFinal Answer:\n[+4500kJ]"

    "difficulty": 3,
    "answer": "**Solution**\n\n**Step 1**\n**ANSWER**:\nIn this problem, we will deal with the interaction of light with a thin soap film that gives an idea about refraction, interference, and optical path difference. As light strikes the film, part of it reflects off from the top surface, while the part refracts, travels through the film, and reflects from the bottom surface. The two reflected rays interfere because of the difference in their travel path and in phase shifts. Depending on the thickness of the film, the wavelength of light, and the refractive indices, this interference generates either bright (constructive) or dark (destructive) fringes. Path difference is the phase shift generated in the thin film due to incidence and refraction angles. A phase shift will also happen when reflecting from the top surface due to a higher refractive index of the film than in air; hence further complication.\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe interference pattern is dependent upon the combined effect of the geometric path traveled by light inside the film and the additional phase shift due to the reflection. Refraction will change the direction of the light ray inside the film and induce a change in total optical path difference.

    "difficulty": 1,
    "answer": "Step 1\n\nTheory\n\nTo find the electric potential at a point through several point - charges arranged in an equilateral triangle. Electric potential is a scalar quantity associated with a point charge or an electric field, and it is defined as the amount of work done in bringing a positive unit charge from infinity to that point. $\\sigma$ - surface density charge - the electric field does not depend on the shape of the charge. In contrast to electric force, which is a vector quantity that requires vector addition, electric potentials can be directly added algebraically, greatly simplifying the calculations involved.\n\nIn Part A, three equal positive charges are arranged in an equilateral triangle on the corners. Net potential at the centroid is purely positive, calculated by adding contributions of three charges.\n\nIn Part B, one of the charges is flipped to negative, but the other two remain positive. The fact that it is a negative charge means it contributes negatively to the total potential, thereby decreasing the net result. It shows that the sign and magnitudes of charges matter, because their electric potential can increase or decrease the total work required to arrange a test charge to that point.\n\nPart A: Electric Potential at Point (P)\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe electric potential created because of to a point charge written to as:\n$V = k_{e}\\frac{Q}{r}$\n\nHere, every separate charge is $(+Q = + 1\\mu C)$, and $(r = 2m)$ is the separation of each charge from the point (P).\n\n1. Potential because of to one charge:\n$V_{single}=k_{e}\\frac{Q}{r}$\nSubstituting $(k_{e}=8.99\\times10^{9}\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C^{2}}),(Q = 1\\times10^{- 6}C)$, and $(r = 2m)$:\n$V_{single}=\\frac{(8.99\\times10^{9})(1\\times10^{-6})}{2}$\n$V_{single}=4,495V$\n2. net potential at (P) :\nmoreover there are three same / identical charges:\n$V_{total}=3\\times V_{single}=3\\times4,495 = 13,485V$\n\nStep 2\n\nPart B: New Electric Potential if the Top Charge is Negative\n\nExplanation:\n\nIf the upper charge get $(-1\\mu C)$, while the other two remain $(+1\\mu C)$, the net potential at (P) is the add of the potentials:\n\n1. Potential because of the two $(+1\\mu C)$ charges particles:\n$V_{+}=2\\times4,495 = 8,990V$\n2. Potential due to the $(-1\\mu C)$ charge particles:\n$V_{-}=-4,495V$\n3. net total potential:\n$V_{total}=V_{+}+V_{-}=8,990 - 4,495 = 4,495V$\n\nStep 3\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a model example of why electric potential depends on configuration, the size of point charges, and their signs! Since potentials are scalar entities, it can directly added together. In Part A, positive charges are same distance from centroid hence, positive net potential. The configuration is symmetrical so the calculation is simple and shows that electric potential is additive.\n\nIn Part B, we penetrate this idea more, and the net potential decreases when the introduced point return is negative, highlighting how we care as much about the charge sign as we do about the charge magnitude. The above example shows the balance between attractive and repulsive effects in electrostatics. Image guidance extends the electric potential concept, where energy distribution on the charge creates the electric field in the location.\n\nAnswer\n\nFinal Answers:\n- Part A: $(V = 13,485V)$.\n- Part B: $(V = 4,495V)$."

    "answer": "### Solution\n\n**Step 1**\nInitially, when the box is at a distance $d$ from the spring and moving at initial speed $v$, the total energy of the system is,\n$$ E_{i}=\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\\tag{1} $$\nwhere $m$ is the mass and $v$ is the initial speed.\n\nWhen the box comes to rest after compressing the spring by distance $x$, the total energy of the system is given as,\n$$ E_{f}=\\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}\\tag{2} $$\nwhere $k$ is the spring constant.\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe system includes the box and the spring. Its total energy is the sum of the kinetic energy due to the box's motion and the potential energy due to the change in the length of the spring.\nInitially, the spring can be assumed to be at its original length; hence, the potential energy becomes zero. So the total initial energy becomes equal to the initial kinetic energy.\nWhen the box comes to rest by compressing the spring, its kinetic energy becomes zero but it gains potential energy. So the total final energy becomes equal to the final potential energy.\n\n**Step 2**\nThe work done by the friction force on a box moving on a horizontal plane is,\n$$ W =-\\mu_{k}mg(d + x)\\tag{3} $$\nwhere $\\mu_{k}$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $d$ is the initial distance of the box from the spring.\n\nAs per work - energy theorem,\n$$ E_{f}-E_{i}=W\\tag{4} $$\n\nUsing equations (1), (2), and (3) in equation (4),\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}-\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}=-\\mu_{k}mg(d + x) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}=\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}-\\mu_{k}mg(d + x) $$\n$$ k=\\frac{mv^{2}-2\\mu_{k}mg(d + x)}{x^{2}}\\tag{5} $$\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe work done by the friction force on a body depends on the distance traveled by it on the surface. The box first travels a distance $d$ before striking the spring and then travels an additional distance $x$ while compressing the spring. The friction force opposes motion and so the work done by it is negative.\nThe work - energy theorem says that the work done on a body is equal to the change in its energy.\n\n**Step 3**\nThe mass is $m = 5.1\\ kg$\nThe distance $d=16.7\\ m$ and $x = 45\\ cm=0.45\\ m$\nThe coefficient of kinetic friction is $\\mu_{k}=0.48$\nThe acceleration due to gravity is $g = 9.80\\ m/s^{2}$\nThe initial speed of the box is $v = 16.6\\ m/s$\n\n**NOTE**: $1\\ cm=0.01\\ m$. In the calculations, all the values will be in SI units only.\n\nPut the values of $m$, $d$, $x$, $\\mu_{k}$, $g$, and $v$ in equation (5) to determine the spring constant.\n$$ \\begin{align*} k&=\\frac{5.1\\times16.6^{2}-2\\times0.48\\times5.1\\times9.80\\times(16.7 + 0.45)}{0.45^{2}}\\\\ &=\\frac{1405.356-47.9808\\times17.15}{0.2025}\\\\ &=\\frac{1405.356 - 822.87072}{0.2025}\\\\ &=\\frac{582.48528}{0.2025}\\\\ &\\approx2876\\ N/m \\end{align*} $$\n\n### Answer\nThe spring constant is $2876\\ N/m$"

The negative charge is located at the origin $(0,0)$. See the figure given below\n\nExplanation:\n$$ R^{2}=(\\frac{d}{\\sqrt{3}})^{2}+(r - \\frac{d}{\\sqrt{3}})^{2}=\\frac{d^{2}}{3}+r^{2}+\\frac{d^{2}}{3}-2r\\frac{d}{\\sqrt{3}} $$\nSince $d\\ll r$, the term $d^{2}$ can be ignored.\nTherefore $R^{2}=r^{2}-\\sqrt{2}rd$ -----(1)\nUsing Coulomb's law, the field at the black point\n(1) due to the charge $+e$ above the $X -$axis, $E_{1}=\\frac{ke}{R^{2}}$ -----(2)\n(2) due to the charge $+e$ below the $X -$axis, $E_{2}=\\frac{ke}{R^{2}}$ -----(3)\n(3) due to the charge $- 2e$, $E_{3}=\\frac{2ke}{r^{2}}$ -----(4)\n\nStep 3\nThe $Y$ components of $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ cancel each other but the $X -$components are added together.

    "answer": "Step 1\nConceptual Introduction:\nIn vector mathematics, understanding the relationships between vectors in geometric shapes such as parallelograms is fundamental. A parallelogram is defined by its two pairs of equal and parallel sides, which can be represented by vectors. The vectors representing the sides of the parallelogram can be used to express other vectors, such as diagonals or resultants, within the shape. This problem requires expressing the vector $\\vec{R}$ in terms of the vectors $\\vec{A}$, $\\vec{B}$, $\\vec{C}$, and $\\vec{D}$ which represent the edges of a parallelogram.\nExplanation:\nThe significance of this conceptual framework lies in its application to vector addition and subtraction, which are essential operations in physics and engineering for determining resultant forces, displacements, and other vector quantities. By understanding how to express one vector in terms of others within a parallelogram, one can solve complex problems involving vector components and their interactions.\n\nDetailed Step - By - Step Solution:\nStep 1: Identify the Properties of the Parallelogram\nIn a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in magnitude and direction. Therefore, the vectors representing these sides satisfy the following relationships:\n$\\vec{A}=\\vec{C}$ and $\\vec{B}=\\vec{D}$\nThis equality is crucial because it allows the simplification of vector expressions by substituting one vector for another.\nExplanation:\nRecognizing that opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal helps in reducing the number of unique vectors in the problem. This simplification is essential for expressing $\\vec{R}$ in terms of the given vectors.\n\nStep 2\nStep 2: Express $\\vec{R}$ Using Vector Addition\nOne of the diagonals of the parallelogram can be expressed as the sum of two adjacent vectors. For instance, if $\\vec{R}$ represents a diagonal, it can be expressed as:\n$\\vec{R}=\\vec{A}+\\vec{B}$\nThis is because, in vector addition, the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by two vectors is the sum of those vectors.\nExplanation:\nVector addition is used here to find the resultant vector that spans from one corner of the parallelogram to the opposite corner. This step leverages the geometric interpretation of vector addition in parallelograms.\n\nStep 3\nStep 3: Verify the Expression with Given Options\nReview the provided options to find the one that matches the derived expression:\n$\\vec{R}=\\vec{A}+\\vec{B}$\nThis corresponds to option 4 in the list:\n4. $\\vec{R}=\\vec{B}+\\vec{A}$\nSince vector addition is commutative, $\\vec{A}+\\vec{B}$ is equivalent to $\\vec{B}+\\vec{A}$.\nExplanation:\nVerification ensures that the derived expression aligns with one of the provided options, confirming the correctness of the solution.\n\nStep 4: Consider Alternative Expressions for $\\vec{R}$\nWhile $\\vec{R}=\\vec{A}+\\vec{B}$ is a valid expression, other expressions might also be valid depending on the specific definition of $\\vec{R}$. For example, if $\\vec{R}$ represents the other diagonal, it could be expressed as:\n$\\vec{R}=\\vec{A}-\\vec{B}$\nThis corresponds to option 5 in the list:\n5. $\\vec{R}=\\vec{A}-\\vec{B}$\nBoth expressions are valid depending on the direction and definition of $\\vec{R}$.\nExplanation:\nConsidering alternative expressions ensures a comprehensive understanding of how $\\vec{R}$ can be represented based on different geometric interpretations within the parallelogram.\n\nAnswer\n\nConclusion:\nThe vector $\\vec{R}$ in a parallelogram can be effectively expressed in terms of the edge vectors $\\vec{A}$, $\\vec{B}$, $\\vec{C}$, and $\\vec{D}$. By leveraging the properties of parallelograms, vector addition, it is determined that $\\vec{R}=\\vec{A}+\\vec{B}$ (option 4) and $\\vec{R}=\\vec{A}-\\vec{B}$ (option 5) are valid expressions depending on the specific geometric context. This solution demonstrates the application of vector mathematics to geometric problems, providing a clear and methodical approach to expressing vectors within parallelograms."

    "answer": "Explanation:\n1. To find the net force on $q_3$ in the direction $y$\n2. Use Coulomb's Law to calculate the forces between $q_3$ and the other two charges ($q_1$ and $q_2$)\n3. Decompose the forces into their $x -$ and $y -$components.\n4. Since the charges are symmetrically placed, the forces in the $x -$direction cancel out, and only the $y -$components contribute to the net force.\n5. The net force in the $y -$direction is the sum of the vertical components of the forces from $q_1$ and $q_2$\n\nLet's go over the procedure step - by - step to determine the net force on $q_3$ in the $y -$direction. Although it's crucial to understand the precise arrangement and separations between the charges, I'll assume a typical setup in which $q_1$ and $q_2$ are symmetrically positioned with respect to $q_3$\n\nGiven:\n$q_1=q_2 = 6.0\\times10^{- 6}\\text{C}$\n$q_3=1.0\\times10^{-6}\\text{C}$\ncoulombs constant $k_0 = 8.99\\times10^{9}\\text{N}\\cdot\\frac{\\text{m}^2}{\\text{C}^2}$\n\nStep 2\nAssumed Configuration:\n1. The charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ are located on the $x -$axis at equal distances from $q_3$ which is along the $y -$axis.\n2. The distance between $q_1$ and $q_3$ is $r_{13}=r$ and the distance between $q_1$ and $q_2$ is also $r_{23}=r$ with the charges placed symmetrically.\n\nstep1: Calculate the force between $q_1$ and $q_3$\nThe force between the two charges is given by:\n$F = k_0\\frac{|q_1q_3|}{r^{2}}$\n$F_{13}=(8.99\\times 10^{9})\\frac{(6.0\\times 10^{-6})(1.0\\times 10^{-6})}{r^{2}}$\n$F_{13}=\\frac{8.99\\times10^{9}\\times6.0\\times10^{- 12}}{r^{2}}$\n$F_{13}=\\frac{53.94\\times10^{-3}}{r^{2}}\\text{N}$\nThis is the magnitude of the force between $q_1$ and $q_3$. Now, let's determine the components of this force in the $x -$ and $y -$directions.\n\nStep 2: Break the force into components\nSince $q_1$ is along the $x -$axis (relative to $q_3$) and the angle between the force vector and the $y -$axis is $90^{\\circ}$\n- The force due to $q_1$ on $q_3$ will have an $x -$component and a $y -$component.\n- The force in the $y -$direction will be zero for $q_1$ because it's only along the $x -$axis.\n\nStep 3\nSimilarly, the force between $q_1$ and $q_3$ will be the same in magnitude:\n$F_{23}=(8.99\\times 10^{9})\\frac{(6.0\\times 10^{-6})(1.0\\times 10^{-6})}{r^{2}}$\n$F_{23}=\\frac{53.94\\times10^{-3}}{r^{2}}\\text{N}$\nThe force owing to $q_2$ along $x$ - axis on $q_2$ on $q_3$ will also have comparable components, but in the opposite direction along the $x -$axis, because $q_2$ is likewise along the $x -$axis (symmetrically positioned).\n\nstep 4: Net force in the $y -$direction\nOnly the components in the $y -$direction from both forces will contribute to the net force on $q_3$ because of the setup's symmetry, which causes the forces in the $x -$direction to cancel each other out.\n$F_{y,net}=0\\text{N}$\n\nAnswer\nconclusion:\nThe net force on $q_3$ in the $y -$direction is zero in this imagined setup, because the forces in the $x -$direction cancel each other out.\nNonetheless, the $y -$component would have to be computed appropriately if the arrangement of charges differed (for instance, if $q_1$ and $q_2$ are at different angles or locations).If the necessary data is available to supply a more thorough setup!"

The leaves gain the same negative charge and repel each other.\nSo this option is the correct one.\n(B) This image shows positive charge on both the leaves and the ball.\nThis images means that positive charges move in the conductor which is not possible.\nThe leaves cannot both gain positive charges through induction while the ball remains positive.\nThis option is hence incorrect.\n(C) This image shows no movement of charges.\nThe negatively charged rod near the electroscope, it induces a charge separation. So this option is wrong.\n(D) This image shows negative charges on the ball and positive charges on the leaves.\nWhen a negatively charged rod is near, electrons are repelled downward and not attracted upward. So this option is incorrect.\n(E) This image shows negative charges on both the leaves and the ball.\nThe negative charges are repelled from the ball, so they cannot accumulate on both the leaves and the ball simultaneously. Hence, this option is also incorrect.\n\nExplanation:\nElectrostatic induction is the process of redistribution of electric charge in an object due to the presence of nearby charged object.\n\nAnswer\nThe image which describes what happens is option A.\nThe correct answer is option A."

    "answer": "**Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Torque on the loop and its behavior**\n\n**Step 1: Magnetic moment of the loop**\nThe magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ of a current - carrying loop is given by:\n$\\vec{\\mu}=I\\cdot\\vec{A}\\cdot\\hat{n}$\nWhere:\n- $I$ is the current in the loop.\n- $\\vec{A}=a\\cdot b$ is the area of the rectangular loop ($a$ and $b$ are the sides of the rectangle).\n- $\\hat{n}$ is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane of the loop, determined by the right - hand rule.\nThus:\n$|\\vec{\\mu}| = I\\cdot(a\\cdot b)$\n\n**Step 2: Torque on the loop**\nThe torque $\\vec{\\tau}$ on the loop in a magnetic field $\\vec{B}_{ext}$ is:\n$\\vec{\\tau}=\\vec{\\mu}\\times\\vec{B}_{ext}$\nThe magnitude of the torque is:\n$|\\vec{\\tau}|=|\\vec{\\mu}|\\cdot|\\vec{B}_{ext}|\\cdot\\sin\\theta$\nSubstituting the value of $|\\vec{\\mu}|$:\n$\\tau = I\\cdot(a\\cdot b)\\cdot B_{ext}\\cdot\\sin\\theta$\n\n**Step 3: Behavior of the loop**\nThe torque will try to align the magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ with the external magnetic field $\\vec{B}_{ext}$. If the loop is not held in place:\n- It will rotate to minimize the angle $\\theta$, eventually aligning $\\vec{\\mu}$ parallel to $\\vec{B}_{ext}$.\n- This happens because the system tries to reach a state of minimum potential energy.\nExplanation:\nAs for the torque applied to the loop, current, the dimensions of the loop, magnetic field and angle $\\theta$ characterize the torque. Due to this torque, the loop will rotate in order to keep $\\theta$ as small as possible, i.e., bring $\\vec{\\mu}$ into line with $\\vec{B}_{ext}$. This behavior is as a result of the system looking forward to minimizing its magnetic potential energy.\n\n**Step 2: Equation of motion**\n\n**Step 1: Torque and small - angle approximation**\nFrom Part 1, the torque is:\n$\\tau = I\\cdot(a\\cdot b)\\cdot B_{ext}\\cdot\\sin\\theta$\nFor small angles ($\\theta\\approx0$), we use the approximation $\\sin\\theta\\approx\\theta$. The torque becomes:\n$\\tau\\approx I\\cdot(a\\cdot b)\\cdot B_{ext}\\cdot\\theta$\n\n**Step 2: Rotational dynamics**\nUsing the rotational form of Newton's second law:\n$\\tau = I_{total}\\cdot\\alpha$\nWhere:\n- $I_{total}$ is the moment of inertia of the loop about the axis of rotation.\n- $\\alpha=\\frac{d^{2}\\theta}{dt^{2}}$ is the angular acceleration.\nSubstituting $\\tau$:\n$I\\cdot(a\\cdot b)\\cdot B_{ext}\\cdot\\theta = I_{total}\\cdot\\frac{d^{2}\\theta}{dt^{2}}$\nThis simplifies to:\n$\\frac{d^{2}\\theta}{dt^{2}}+\\omega^{2}\\theta = 0$\nWhere:\n$\\omega^{2}=\\frac{I\\cdot(a\\cdot b)\\cdot B_{ext}}{I_{total}}$\n\n**Step 3: Solution of the equation**\nThe equation:\n$\\frac{d^{2}\\theta}{dt^{2}}+\\omega^{2}\\theta = 0$\nis a simple harmonic motion (SHM) equation. Its solution is:\n$\\theta(t)=\\theta_{0}\\cos(\\omega t+\\phi)$\nWhere:\n- $\\theta_{0}$ is the initial angular displacement.\n- $\\phi$ is the phase constant determined by initial conditions.\n- $\\omega=\\sqrt{\\frac{I\\cdot(a\\cdot b)\\cdot B_{ext}}{I_{total}}}$ is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n\n**Step 4: Reversing the current direction**\nIf the current ($I$) is reversed, the direction of the magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ reverses. As a result:\n- The torque $\\vec{\\tau}=\\vec{\\mu}\\times\\vec{B}_{ext}$ also reverses direction.\n- This reversal causes the loop to rotate in the opposite direction, trying to align the new $\\vec{\\mu}$ with $\\vec{B}_{ext}$.\nExplanation:\nFor small angles the loop oscillates simple harmonically as the torque seeks to restore the loop to an equilibrium position. The angular frequency ($\\omega$) here is a loop current - dependent together with the dimensions of the loop, magnetic field and the moment of inertia experienced by the moment of inertia. Basically, when the current flow direction is reversed, the torque produced sets the loop in reverse motion, thus achieving the desired performance.\n\n**Answer**\n(a) $\\tau = I\\cdot(a\\cdot b)\\cdot B_{ext}\\cdot\\sin\\theta$. The loop rotates to align its magnetic moment with $\\vec{B}_{ext}$.\n(b) $\\frac{d^{2}\\theta}{dt^{2}}+\\omega^{2}\\theta = 0$, with $\\omega=\\sqrt{\\frac{I\\cdot(a\\cdot b)\\cdot B_{ext}}{I_{total}}}$. The motion is SHM.\n(c) Reversing $I$ reverses $\\vec{\\mu}$ and $\\vec{\\tau}$, causing opposite rotation."

The $x$ - component of $\\vec{B}$ is $B_x = B\\cos45^{\\circ}=106.689\\cos45^{\\circ}$ and the $y$ - component is $B_y = B\\sin45^{\\circ}=106.689\\sin45^{\\circ}$. The $x$ - component of $\\vec{C}$ is $C_x=-C\\cos\\theta$ and the $y$ - component is $C_y = C\\sin\\theta$, and $A_x = 0$, $A_y=-9.81N$.\n    - Since the system is in static equilibrium, $\\sum F_x = 0$ and $\\sum F_y = 0$.\n        - $\\sum F_x=B_x + C_x=0$, so $106.689\\cos45^{\\circ}-100\\cos\\theta = 0$.\n        - $\\sum F_y=B_y + C_y+A_y = 0$, so $106.689\\sin45^{\\circ}+100\\sin\\theta-9.81 = 0$.\nFor the second force - vector diagram:\n- Given $\\vec{A}=100N$ along the negative $y$ - axis, $\\vec{B}$ at an angle of $45^{\\circ}$ with the $x$ - axis, and $\\vec{C}$ at an angle of $35^{\\circ}$ with the negative $x$ - axis.\n    - Resolve the vectors into components.

    "answer": "The graph shows the velocity of an object moving in a straight - line over time.\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe object starts at rest (velocity = 0 m/s) at time 0 s. The object's velocity increases steadily to 30 m/s at time 2 s. The object maintains a constant velocity of 30 m/s from time 2 s to time 5 s. The object's velocity decreases steadily to 50 m/s at time 8 s.\n\n**Total displacement**:\nThe total displacement of the object can be found by calculating the area under the velocity - time graph. The graph can be divided into three sections:\n- **Section A**: A triangle with base from 0 to 2 s and height 30 m/s. The area of this section is $\\frac{1}{2}\\times2\\times30 = 30m$.\n- **Section B**: A rectangle with base from 2 s to 5 s and height 30 m/s. The area of this section is $3\\times30 = 90m$.\n- **Section C**: A triangle with base from 5 s to 8 s and height $(50 - 30)=20$ m/s. The area of this section is $3\\times30+\\frac{1}{2}\\times3\\times20 = 120m$.\nTherefore, the total displacement of the object is $30 + 90+120 = 240m$.\n\n**Acceleration - time relationship**:\nThe acceleration vs time graph can be obtained by calculating the slope of the velocity - time graph at each point.\n- **Section A**: The slope of the line is positive, which means the acceleration is positive. The acceleration is constant and can be calculated as the change in velocity divided by the change in time: $\\frac{30 - 0}{2 - 0}=15\\frac{m}{s^{2}}$.\n- **Section B**: The slope of the line is 0, which means the acceleration is 0 m/s².\n- **Section C**: The slope of the line is positive, which means the acceleration is positive. The acceleration is constant and can be calculated as the change in velocity divided by the change in time: $\\frac{50 - 30}{8 - 5}=6.66\\frac{m}{s^{2}}$.\n\n**Answer**:\nTherefore, the acceleration vs time graph would be a piece - wise linear graph with a positive slope in section A, a horizontal line in section B, and again positive slope in section C. The slopes of the lines would be $15m/s^{2}$ and $6.66m/s^{2}$ in sections A and C, respectively."

    "answer": "1. **Step 1: Given data and lens - formula introduction**\n   - Given: $s = 11cm$, $f= + 5cm$\n   - The lens formula is $\\frac{1}{v}-\\frac{1}{u}=\\frac{1}{f}$, where $v$ is the image - distance from the pole, $u$ is the object - distance from the pole, and $f$ is the focal distance.\n2. **Step 2: Applying the lens formula for the first case ($u=-11cm$)**\n   - Substitute $u = - 11cm$ and $f = 5cm$ into the lens formula $\\frac{1}{v}-\\frac{1}{u}=\\frac{1}{f}$, we get $\\frac{1}{v}-\\frac{1}{-11}=\\frac{1}{5}$.\n   - Then $\\frac{1}{v}=\\frac{1}{5}-\\frac{1}{11}$.\n   - Calculate $\\frac{1}{5}-\\frac{1}{11}=\\frac{11 - 5}{55}=\\frac{6}{55}$, so $v=\\frac{55}{6}\\approx9.17cm$.\n   - The magnification $m=\\frac{v}{u}$, substituting $v = 9.17cm$ and $u=-11cm$, we have $m=\\frac{9.17}{-11}\\approx - 0.83$.

    "answer": "**Step 1**\nEl problema consiste en deducir expresiones simbólicas para los puntos P y P'.\nPara resolver este problema, debemos tener en cuenta las siguientes consideraciones:\n- Puesto que ambas cargas son positivas, sabemos que se repelen entre sí. La ley de Coulomb establece que las cargas iguales se repelen.\n- Sabemos que la fuerza resultante depende de la magnitud de las cargas y de la distancia entre ellas.\n- Para calcular el campo eléctrico en un punto del espacio, se utiliza la fórmula $E = k\\times\\frac{q}{r^{2}}$, donde $k = 9\\times10^{9}\\ N\\times\\frac{m^{2}}{C^{2}}$ es la constante eléctrica y $r$ es la distancia.\n- Dicha fórmula calcula el módulo del campo eléctrico en un punto del espacio, ubicado a la distancia $r$. Es importante mencionar que los vectores de campo eléctrico poseen componentes en los ejes $X$ y $Y$ (como campo eléctrico es un vector).\n- El campo eléctrico total será la suma (o resta) de los campos eléctricos que cada partícula genera en $P$ y $P'$.\n\nExplanation:\nLa estrategia para resolver este problema consiste en encontrar el campo eléctrico que genera cada partícula, y sumarlos para obtener el campo total en cada punto. También será necesario incluir la dirección. Es útil hacer un diagrama donde se observe el campo eléctrico que cada carga genera.\n\n**Step 2**\nEn primer lugar, dibujemos un diagrama sencillo de los vectores de campo eléctrico.\n\nEn este diagrama simplificado, se puede observar que el vector de campo eléctrico generado por la carga $q_1$ en el punto $P$ es colineal a dicha carga, y como apunta hacia la izquierda, su componente en el eje $Y$ es 0.\nLo mismo ocurre con el vector de campo eléctrico $\\vec{E}_{q2}$ que la carga $q_2$ genera en $P$. Los ángulos que forman estos vectores con el eje $Y$ son de $0^{\\circ}$ y $180^{\\circ}$ respectivamente, y por tanto no poseen componente en el eje $Y$.\n\nExplanation:\nEl hecho de que existan 2 vectores de campo eléctrico que no tienen componente en el eje $Y$ simplifica el trabajo, puesto que sus expresiones solo contendrán componentes en el eje $X$. Puesto que el coseno del ángulo $0^{\\circ}$ y $180^{\\circ}$ poseen valores bien - conocidos ($\\cos(0^{\\circ}) = 1$ y $\\cos(180^{\\circ})=- 1$), entonces el campo eléctrico con componentes solo en el eje $X$ es más fácil de expresar.\n\n**Step 3**\nAhora, el vector campo eléctrico $\\vec{E}_{q1}$ forma un ángulo de $45^{\\circ}$ con los ejes $X$ y $Y$ (los ángulos del triángulo son de $45 - 45-90$) y por lo tanto se puede expresar de la siguiente manera:\n$\\vec{E}_{q1}=k\\times\\frac{q_1}{r^{2}}\\times(\\cos(45^{\\circ})\\vec{i}+\\sin(45^{\\circ})\\vec{j})$\nEn donde $\\vec{i}$ y $\\vec{j}$ son vectores unitarios en las direcciones $X$ e $Y$ respectivamente.\nVale destacar que ya que el vector $\\vec{E}_{q1}$ apunta hacia arriba y hacia la izquierda, su componente $X$ es negativa. Así, podemos re - escribir la expresión de la siguiente manera:\n$\\vec{E}_{q1}=k\\times\\frac{q_1}{r^{2}}\\times(-\\cos(45^{\\circ})\\vec{i}+\\sin(45^{\\circ})\\vec{j})$\nAhora debemos plantear una expresión análoga para $\\vec{E}_{q2}$. El vector campo eléctrico $\\vec{E}_{q2}$ forma un ángulo de $135^{\\circ}$ con el eje $X$ (o $45^{\\circ}$ con el eje $X$ negativo).\n$\\vec{E}_{q2}=k\\times\\frac{q_2}{r^{2}}\\times(-\\cos(45^{\\circ})\\vec{i}-\\sin(45^{\\circ})\\vec{j})$\nExplanation:\nRecordar que resolver una multiplicación entre una magnitud escalar ($k\\times\\frac{q}{r^{2}}$) y un vector unitario ($\\vec{i}$ o $\\vec{j}$) otorga un vector con magnitud proporcional a la magnitud escalar y dirección del vector unitario. En este caso, estamos descomponiendo el vector de campo eléctrico en componentes $X$ e $Y$.\n\n**Step 4**\nPor último, resta sumar las expresiones de $\\vec{E}_{q1}$ y $\\vec{E}_{q2}$ para obtener el campo eléctrico total en el punto $P$ y de manera análoga para el campo eléctrico en $P'$.\n\n$\\vec{E}_{P}=\\vec{E}_{q1}+\\vec{E}_{q2}$\n$\\vec{E}_{P}=(k\\times\\frac{q_1}{r^{2}}\\times(\\cos(0^{\\circ})\\vec{i}+\\sin(0^{\\circ})\\vec{j}))+(k\\times\\frac{q_2}{r^{2}}\\times(-\\cos(0^{\\circ})\\vec{i}+\\sin(0^{\\circ})\\vec{j}))$\n\nY de manera análoga para $P'$:\n$\\vec{E}_{P'}=\\vec{E}_{q1}'+\\vec{E}_{q2}'$\n$\\vec{E}_{P'}=(k\\times\\frac{q_1}{r^{2}}\\times(-\\cos(45^{\\circ})\\vec{i}-\\sin(45^{\\circ})\\vec{j}))+(k\\times\\frac{q_2}{r^{2}}\\times(-\\cos(45^{\\circ})\\vec{i}-\\sin(45^{\\circ})\\vec{j}))$\n\n**Answer**\nLas expresiones para campo eléctrico neto en $P$ y $P'$ son las siguientes:\n- $\\vec{E}_{P}=(k\\times\\frac{q_1}{r^{2}}\\times(\\cos(0^{\\circ})\\vec{i}+\\sin(0^{\\circ})\\vec{j}))+(k\\times\\frac{q_2}{r^{2}}\\times(-\\cos(0^{\\circ})\\vec{i}+\\sin(0^{\\circ})\\vec{j}))$\n- $\\vec{E}_{P'}=(k\\times\\frac{q_1}{r^{2}}\\times(-\\cos(45^{\\circ})\\vec{i}-\\sin(45^{\\circ})\\vec{j}))+(k\\times\\frac{q_2}{r^{2}}\\times(-\\cos(45^{\\circ})\\vec{i}-\\sin(45^{\\circ})\\vec{j}))$\n![](images/139839740_ddbfa924df017127174a57555a0ef79408f082d5e7d6841d697dc59e4043d2b8.jpg)\n![](images/139839740_e9556991c62b4c8369da6ec6e72f33b193d0fb7b1769002af37da39619d048e8.jpg)"

The vertical displacement of the proton is $\\Delta y = 1.0\\times10^{-3}\\ m$.\nExplanation:\nThe proton starts at the upper plate and just misses the lower plate. $1\\ mm = 1\\times10^{-3}\\ m$ is used to write it in meters.\nThe initial vertical velocity of the proton is $v_{0y}=0$.\nExplanation:\nIts initial velocity $\\vec{v}_{0}$ is horizontal.\nThe mass of a proton is $m = 1.67\\times10^{-27}\\ kg$.\nUse Newton's second law and find its acceleration.

    "subtopic": "Mechanics",

    "difficulty": 3,
    "answer": "**Step 1**\nThe bowling ball travels towards the left with constant velocity, thus the acceleration in normal conditions is zero.\nWhen struck by the mallet in the forward direction, some force $\\mathbf{F}$ is applied by it in the positive direction. Thus by Newton's Second Law acceleration caused due to this momentary force is $a = F/m$.\n**Explanation**:\nNewton's second law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net - force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass, expressed by the equation $\\mathbf{\\vec{F}}=m\\cdot\\mathbf{\\vec{a}}$.\n\n**Step 2**\nThus everytime the ball is hit, a momentary positive acceleration (in same direction as force) acts on the ball to slow it down.\nSo correct graph is D.\n**Explanation**:\nSpikes of acceleration also give rise to a phenomenon called impulse.\n\n**Answer**\nThe best representation is Graph D."

    "answer": "1. **Step 1 - Part a**:\n   - Given:\n     - Length of the strings, $L = 0.35m$.\n     - Mass of the string $S_1$, $m = 0.008kg$.\n     - Frequency of vibration of $S_1$ in its fundamental - mode $n = 1$, $f=262Hz$.\n     - The formula for the frequency of a vibrating string is $f=\\frac{1}{2L}\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}$, where $T$ is the tension in the string and $\\mu=\\frac{m}{L}$ is the mass per unit length (linear mass density of the string).\n     - Rearranging the formula for $T$:\n       - $T=(2L\\times f)^2\\times\\mu$. Since $\\mu = \\frac{m}{L}$, we have $T = 4L^{2}f^{2}\\times\\frac{m}{L}=4Lf^{2}m$.\n       - Substituting the values $L = 0.35m$, $f = 262Hz$, and $m = 0.008kg$:\n         - $T=4\\times0.35\\times(262)^{2}\\times0.008\\approx770N$.\n2. **Step 2 - Part b**:\n   - Given $f_2 = 466Hz$.\n   - Starting from $f=\\frac{1}{2L}\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}$, and since $\\mu=\\frac{m}{L}$, we can rewrite it for $m_2$.\n     - $f_2=\\frac{1}{2L}\\sqrt{\\frac{T\\times L}{m_2}}$, then $m_2=\\frac{T\\times L}{4L^{2}f_{2}^{2}}=\\frac{T}{4Lf_{2}^{2}}$.\n     - Substituting $T = 770N$, $L = 0.35m$, and $f_2 = 466Hz$:\n       - $m_2=\\frac{770}{4\\times0.35\\times466^{2}}=\\frac{770}{304018.4}=0.00253kg$.\n3. **Step 3 - Part c**:\n   - Let $L'=L - x$ be the new length where the string produces C - sharp (frequency of $f' = 277Hz$).\n   - The frequency formula is $f'=\\frac{1}{2L'}\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}=\\frac{1}{2(L - x)}\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}$.\n   - From step 1, $f_1=\\frac{1}{2L}\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}$.\n   - Since the tension $T$ and the linear mass density $\\mu$ remain constant, we have $2L\\times f_1=2(L - x)\\times f'$.\n     - Simplifying gives $L\\times f_1=(L - x)\\times f'$, then $L - x=\\frac{L\\times f_1}{f'}$.\n     - Substituting $L = 0.35m$, $f_1 = 262Hz$, and $f' = 277Hz$:\n       - $L - x=\\frac{0.35\\times262}{277}=0.331m$.\n       - Solving for $x$, $x = L-0.331=0.35 - 0.331 = 0.019m$.\n4. **Step 4 - Part d**:\n   - Since $L'$ is the same for both the strings, the frequency of sound for $S_2$ is given by $f=\\frac{1}{2L'}\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}$.\n   - Substituting $L'=L - x=0.331m$, $T = 770N$, and $m_2 = 0.00253kg$ (and $\\mu=\\frac{m_2}{L}$):\n     - $f=\\frac{1}{2(L - x)}\\sqrt{\\frac{T\\times L}{m_2}}=\\frac{1}{2\\times0.331}\\sqrt{\\frac{770\\times0.35}{0.00253}}\\approx494Hz$.\n\n5. **Answer**:\n   - Part a: $T = 770N$.\n   - Part b: $m_2 = 0.00253kg$.\n   - Part c: $x = 0.019m$.\n   - Part d: $f = 494Hz$."

    "answer": "### Step 1\n**Explanation**:\nCurrent in a CR - circuit is given by, $I=\\frac{E}{R}e^{-\\frac{t}{RC}}$ where $R$ is the net resistance of the circuit.\nAt $t = 0s$, switch $S3$ is closed. $S1$ and $S2$ are opened. Since the capacitor is not connected to the battery, the voltage is zero. Hence, current $I = 0$.\n\n### Step 2\n**Given**:\nAt time $t=t_1$, switch $S1$ and $S3$ are closed, and the students wait for a long time until the circuit reaches equilibrium.\n**Explanation**:\nWhen switches $S3$ and $S1$ are closed, the net resistance of the circuit is $R$. Therefore, current as a function of time $t$ is $I=\\frac{E}{R}e^{-\\frac{t}{RC}}$, and the graph is an exponentially - decreasing graph.\nThe graph of the function has the current $I$ on the y - axis and time $t$ on the x - axis, and the curve is $I=\\frac{E}{R}e^{-\\frac{t}{RC}}$.\n\n### Step 3\n**Given**:\nAt time $t = t_2$, $S1$ is opened, and $S2$ is closed simultaneously. $S3$ remains closed.\n**Explanation**:\nOnce $S1$ is opened, there is no more charging of the capacitor. The capacitor is already fully charged. When $S2$ is closed, the net resistance of the circuit, $R + R=2R$. So the net resistance of the circuit is increased. Since the capacitor is charged, it will discharge now, through the $2R$ resistance, and charge to its opposite terminals. There is a re - charging of the capacitor with opposite terminals taking place. But this time the maximum current reached is $E/2R$ and current as a function of time $t$ is, $I=\\frac{E}{2R}e^{-\\frac{t}{2RC}}$. The re - charging of the capacitor graph has current $I$ on the y - axis and time $t$ on the x - axis, and the curve is $I=\\frac{E}{2R}e^{-\\frac{t}{2RC}}$.\n\n**Answer**:\nThe graphs are given above......\n![](images/128882582_05f7b757860df2f091192f77c0267c720c531abbf5eef6ae86c28b983465b439.jpg)\n![](images/128882582_b20873574cb5a207032fb19fa9ef70595385f199dc36fb0d2c67fd72d1b462f2.jpg)"

For motion of any body on the earth, earth forms an inertial frame.\n\nStep 2\nc)\nFrame of reference moving with the cart is non - inertial frame. Along with cart, it is also moving with acceleration, so it is non - inertial. So, Newton’s law will not be followed.\nWith this reference, block A is at rest.\nBlock is at rest, even though a force $ma$ is applied on it. So, it does not follow Newton's law.\nTo satisfy Newton's law, a pseudo - force is assumed to be acting on it. This force is $- ma$.\nSo, total force on block A $=ma - ma = 0$\nSo, net force is zero. So, the block will be at rest in this frame.\nThus Newton's law is satisfied.\n\nAnswer\n(b)\nNewton’s law is satisfied.\n\n(c)\nNewton’s law is not satisfied. To make it satisfy, a pseudo - force is assumed to be acting on it."

    "answer": "Step 1\n\nQuestion 4:\nAnalysis: Each fit equation indicated on the provided image refers to a specific fitted model for the data, be it linear, polynomial, logarithmic, or exponential decay. These equations such as can describe the following trends:\n- Linear fit refers to a straight - line approximation with constant slope.\n- Quadratic fit captures the parabolic trend.\n- Logarithmic fit and exponential decay fit both capture non - linear trends and gradual change, or a saturation phenomenon.\n\nExplanation:\nSome of these models are less complex than others and for this reason some results will differ. The differences are RMSE and correlation, that is achieved from goodness of fit. They stem from the fact that these data may depend more on some mathematical models than others due to the physical phenomena that they represent.\n\nStep 2\n\nQuestion 5:\nAnalysis: RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) describes how far the predicted model is from the data:\n- Linear Fit RMSE : 2.763 m\n- Quadratic Fit RMSE : 2.192 m\n- Logarithmic Fit RMSE : 1.254 m\n- Exponential Fit RMSE : 1.810 m\n\nBest Fit: The logarithmic fit RMSE value is the lowest (1.254 m), meaning it is arguably the best fit for the data trend. Almost as Good: The exponential fit (RMSE = 1.810 m) is near, though not exactly as good. The difference in RMSE shows that the logarithmic model is better, but only slightly.\n\nExplanation:\nThe RMSE depicts the average difference in values as compared to the averages and gives the distance of the given values from the central point in the set of values. The model with the lowest RMSE is said to fit better in comparison to other models. Using RMSE, we can determine which model, out of the several examined ones, fits the set of data best, however, those with close RMSE are said to perform similarly and those with larger differences are said to have a preferred model.\n\nStep 3\n\nQuestion 6:\nThe data shows a car speeding up and then gradually slowing down, the Exponential Fit is likely the most correct. This is because:\nExponential decay behavior: The acceleration and deceleration of cars is largely exponential for a whole range of reasons, such as drag forces or braking.\nRMSE Validity: It is accepted that RMSE validity ratio provides the most accurate result, therefore this car acceleration scenario provides the optimal approach.\nNevertheless, the Quadratic Fit may also describe the system because:\nParabolic trajectories: Quadratic fits are very common for describing motion that is uniformly accelerated.\nConceptual Simplicity: The two words summary, acceleration and deceleration gives sufficient indication of what is happening in the system under consideration.\n\nExplanation:\nAlternative Consideration: In the case where the system is more influenced by other forces, such as friction and air resistance the Exponential Fit is more realistic. Else in more simple cases where these assumptions are not taken into account, the Quadratic Fit would be acceptable.\n\nAnswer\n\nConclusion:\nThe Exponential Fit stands out as the best model due to its lowest RMSE value (1.810 m), and it describes well the physics of a car acceleration wit gradual deceleration as it comes to a halt along with realistic braking and drag forces. The Quadratic Fit seems to be a fair alternative but is much simpler at a cost of accuracy."

    "question": "Use the following information to answer the next two questions.\nCyclotron\nA cyclotron is one type of particle accelerator that can be used to accelerate charged particles to very high energies. A cyclotron consists of two hollow metal electrodes that are each shaped like the letter D. The Ds are placed in a vacuum and an external magnetic field is added. Charged particles are injected near the centre of the Ds. An electric potential difference across the D - separation accelerates the charged particles. Once inside one of the Ds, the charged particles follow a circular path. As they reach the D - separation, the electric potential difference reverses so that the particles are, again, accelerated. This continues, and each time the charged particles travel faster and faster.\nOne particular cyclotron is shown below. In this cyclotron, the charged particles are protons, the magnetic field strength is $0.863\\ T$, the electric potential difference is $0.200\\ MV$, and the D - separation is $5.00\\ cm$.

    "answer": "**Solution**\n\n**Step 1**\nNow, let's analyze the problem and solve it as follows:\na) Calculation of the mass of the rods.\nMass of a rod is calculated as its linear density ($\\lambda$) multiplied by its length ($L = 4m$).\nNow for the first rod:\n$M_1=\\lambda_1L = 0.25\\frac{kg}{m}\\times4m = 1.0kg$\nNow for the second rod:\n$M_2=\\lambda_2L = 0.5\\times4m = 2.0kg$\nAnd for the third rod:\n$M_3=\\lambda_3L = 0.75\\times4m = 3.0kg$\n\n**Explanation**:\nA rod's linear density ($\\lambda$) and length ($L$) determines the mass of a rod. Linear density is the mass per unit length of the oscillating rod. This equation applies for a rod of even density which is essential for rod mass - determination.\n\n**Step 2**\nb) Moment of inertia of a 1 kg point - mass at $L = 4m$\nThe moment of inertia quantifies the amount of resistance an object offers to rotational movement about a given axis. A point - mass can be calculated using the following expression.\n$I=m\\times r^{2}$\n$I = 1\\times(4)^{2}=16kg\\cdot m^{2}$\n\n**Explanation**:\nTo identify in detail: $m$ is the mass, and $r$ refers to the perpendicular distance of mass from the axis of rotation. The greater the distance of the mass from the axis, the higher the values of moment of inertia. This is why rotating a mass with greater distance from the axis is rather difficult.\n\n**Step 3**\nc) Moment of inertia of each rod about an axis passing through its endpoint\nLet us examine a thin rod of uniform mass distribution about an axis parallel to its length and situated at one of its ends.\nThe moment of inertia of this rod is calculated employing integral calculus as follows:\n$I_{rod}=\\frac{1}{3}ML^{2}$\n$I_{rod1}=\\frac{1}{3}M_1L^{2}=\\frac{1}{3}\\times1.0\\times(4)^{2}=5.33kg\\cdot m^{2}$\n$I_{rod2}=\\frac{1}{3}M_2L^{2}=\\frac{1}{3}\\times2.0\\times(4)^{2}=10.67kg\\cdot m^{2}$\n$I_{rod3}=\\frac{1}{3}M_3L^{2}=\\frac{1}{3}\\times3.0\\times(4)^{2}=16.0kg\\cdot m^{2}$\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe formula presented above is obtained when all the small mass portions ($dm$) that compose the length of the rod are integrated, factoring in their distance from the rotational point, with each small mass section's distance measured separately from the rotational point. It indicates the mass - configuration of the rod in relation to its endpoint.\n\n**Step 4**\nd) Complete individual mass distribution of every arm.\nAn arm of a whirligig is made up of:\nA rod whose moment of inertia was computed in subsection c.\nA point - mass located at the extremity of the rod which was computed in subsection b.\nThe moment of inertia of an arm is the total contribution of all the single parts of the arm:\n$I_{arm}=I_{rod}+I_{point - mass}$\n$I_{arm1}=I_{rod1}+I_{point - mass}=5.33 + 16=21.33kg\\cdot m^{2}$\n$I_{arm2}=I_{rod2}+I_{point - mass}=10.67 + 16=26.67kg\\cdot m^{2}$\n$I_{arm3}=I_{rod3}+I_{point - mass}=16.0 + 16=32.0kg\\cdot m^{2}$\n\n**Explanation**:\nThis illustrates the super - position principle of inertia for rotational motion. It states that any system's mass moment of inertia is the sum of all parts it is made of.\n\n**Step 5**\ne) Total moment of inertia of the whirligig\nThe total moment of the whirligig is the cumulative of the moments of inertia of all the three arms. Taking into account that each arm contributes separately to the system's rotation inertia, the moment of inertia can be computed as follows:\n$I_{total}=I_{arm1}+I_{arm2}+I_{arm3}$\n$I_{total}=21.33 + 26.67+32.0 = 80.0kg\\cdot m^{2}$\n\n**Explanation**:\nThis simple example demonstrates the impact of mass distribution and structure geometry on the resistance to rotational movement of the whirligigs.\n\n**Answer**\nThe whirligig's moment of inertia is determined by evaluating the contribution due to the rods and the point - masses located at their ends. By finding the individual moment of inertia for each arm and adding them together, we find the total moment of inertia which defines rotational inertia of the system. This procedure illustrates how mass and geometry affect the behavior of object while rotating."

    "answer": "**Step 1: Explanation**\nForce between two charges is given by Coulomb's law, which states that if there are two charges $q$ and $Q$ placed at a distance of $R$ then force acting between them is given as $F=\\frac{qQ}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0R^{2}}$.\nIf the charges are opposite in nature (like one is positive - charge and the other is negative - charge or vice - versa) then force between them will be attractive, otherwise if charges will be of same nature then force will be repulsive in nature.\nHere we have to evaluate force on charge $Q$ due to charge $q$ placed at every corners. Since magnitude of charges are same hence the magnitude of the forces will also remain same.\nNow let's solve one by one for each setup:\n[Diagram shows a square with charges $+q$ at top - left, bottom - left, bottom - right and $-q$ at top - right, and a $-Q$ charge at the center.

    "answer": "### Step 1\n**Explanation**:\nTo determine the magnitude of the velocity by using the formula for linear in circular motion, $v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}$.\n$v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}$\nwhere;\n- $v$ is the linear velocity.\n- $r$ is the radius of the circle\n- $T$ is the time - period of one revolution.\n**Given**:\n$T = 0.4s$\n$r = 1.2m$\n$v=\\frac{2\\times\\pi\\times1.2}{0.4}$\n$v = 6\\pi$\n$v = 18.85\\frac{m}{s}$\nSo, the magnitude of the velocity is approximately $18.85\\frac{m}{s}$\n\n### Step 2\n**Explanation**:\nTo construct the vector $\\Delta\\vec{V}_0$ by graphically subtracting the corresponding arrows, then plot $\\Delta\\vec{V}_0$ with its tail on the ball at position. Now, address each statement.\n(a). The acceleration $\\vec{a}_0$ points in the same direction as $\\vec{V}_0$.\n\n**Answer**: True. If the velocity is constant, there is no acceleration, and both velocity and acceleration vectors point in the same direction as $\\vec{V}_0$.\n(b). The velocity is always constant.\n**Answer**: False. The velocity changes as the ball moves around the circle, so it's not constant.\n(c). $\\Delta\\vec{V}_0$ points in the same direction as $\\vec{V}_0$.\n**Answer**: True. $\\Delta\\vec{V}_0$ represents the average change in velocity from position - 1 to position 1. Since the motion is symmetric about the top of the circle, the average change in velocity should be pointing in the same direction as the velocity at position $\\vec{V}_0$.\n(d). $\\Delta\\vec{V}_0$ points towards the center of the circle.\n**Answer**: True. Since the velocity vector changes direction as the ball moves along the circular path, $\\Delta\\vec{V}_0$ points towards the center of the circle.\n(e).

As the ball passes position 6, the acceleration $\\Delta\\vec{V}_6$ points towards the center of the circle, as it is directed opposite to the change in velocity.\n\n### Answer\nSo, the magnitude of the velocity is approximately $18.85\\frac{m}{s}$"

Convert distance and time to meters and seconds:\n      - Distance $d = 940\\times10^{6}\\text{ km}=940\\times10^{6}\\times10^{3}\\text{ m}=9.40\\times 10^{11}\\text{ m}$\n      - Time $t = 365.25\\text{ days}\\times24\\text{ hours/day}\\times3600\\text{ seconds/hour}=3.15576\\times 10^{7}\\text{ seconds}$\n      - Speed $v=\\text{Distance}/\\text{Time}=(9.40\\times 10^{11}\\text{ m})/(3.15576\\times 10^{7}\\text{ s}) = 29,783\\text{ m/s}$\n2. **Convert speed to km/h**:\n    - $v = 29,783\\text{ m/s}\\times(3600\\text{ s}/1\\text{ h})\\times(1\\text{ km}/1000\\text{ m})=107,220\\text{ km/h}$\n3. **Convert speed to mi/h**:\n    - $v = 107,220\\text{ km/h}\\times(0.621371\\text{ mi}/1\\text{ km}) = 66,629\\text{ mi/h}$\n    - Explanation: Earth's orbital speed is $29,783\\text{ m/s}$, $107,220\\text{ km/h}$, or $66,629\\text{ mi/h}$\n\n#### Problem 2: Conversions\na) **Kilometers in 1 mile**\n    - 1 foot = 12 inches\n    - 1 inch = 2.54 cm\n    - 1 cm = 0.01 m\n    - 1 mile = 5280 feet $\\times12\\text{ inches/foot}\\times2.54\\text{ cm/inch}\\times(1\\text{ m}/100\\text{ cm})\\times(1\\text{ km}/1000\\text{ m}) = 1.60934\\text{ km}$\n    - Therefore, there are 1.60934 kilometers in 1 mile.\nb) **Milliliter and cubic centimeters**\n    - 1 liter = 1000 cubic centimeters\n    - 1 milliliter=$1\\text{ cm}^3$\n    - Therefore, a milliliter is the same as a cubic centimeter.\nc) **Cubic centimeters in 100 L of water**\n    - 1 liter = 1000 cubic centimeters\n    - $100\\text{ L}=100\\times1000\\text{ cubic centimeters}=100,000\\text{ cubic centimeters}$\n    - Therefore, there are 100,000 cubic centimeters of water in a 100 - L bottle.\n\n#### Problem 3: Approximations of Pi\na) $22/7 = 3.142857$ (to six significant figures)\nb) $355/113=3.141593$ (to six significant figures)\n**Accuracy**:\n    - The actual value of $\\pi$ is approximately 3.14159265.\n    - $|3.142857 - 3.14159265|=0.00126435$\n    - $|3.141593 - 3.14159265| = 3.5\\times10^{-7}$\n    - Therefore, $355/113$ is more accurate to six significant figures.\n\n### Step 2\n\n#### Problem 4: Cell Wall Mass\n**Given**:\n- Cell diameter: $2.0\\ \\mu\\text{m}$\n- Cell wall thickness: $50.0\\ \\text{nm}$\n- Density of wall material: same as pure water ($1\\ \\text{g/cm}^3$)\n\n**Solution**:\n1. **Calculate cell radius**:\n    - Radius $r=\\text{Diameter}/2 = 2.0\\ \\mu\\text{m}/2=1.0\\ \\mu\\text{m}=1.0\\times 10^{- 6}\\text{ m}$\n2. **Calculate cell - wall volume**:\n    - Assume the cell wall is a very thin spherical shell.\n    - Volume $V = 4\\pi r^{2}t$\n    - $r = 1.0\\times 10^{-6}\\text{ m}$, $t = 50.0\\times 10^{-9}\\text{ m}$\n    - $V=4\\times\\pi\\times(1.0\\times 10^{-6}\\text{ m})^{2}\\times(50.0\\times 10^{-9}\\text{ m})=6.28\\times 10^{-19}\\text{ m}^3$\n3. **Convert volume to cubic centimeters**:\n    - $V = 6.28\\times 10^{-19}\\text{ m}^3\\times(100\\text{ cm}/1\\text{ m})^3=6.28\\times 10^{-13}\\text{ cm}^3$\n4. **Calculate cell - wall mass**:\n    - Mass $m=\\text{Volume}\\times\\text{Density}=(6.28\\times 10^{-13}\\text{ cm}^3)\\times(1\\text{ g/cm}^3)=6.28\\times 10^{-13}\\text{ g}$\n    - Therefore, the mass of the cell wall is $6.28\\times 10^{-13}\\text{ g}$\n\n#### Problem 5: Space Station Air Supply\n**Given**:\n- Average human breath: $1/2$ L per breath\n- Time period: 2 weeks\n\n**Solution**:\n1. **Estimate breaths per day**:\n    - Let's assume an average person takes 15 breaths per minute.\n    - Breaths per day $=15\\text{ breaths/minute}\\times60\\text{ minutes/hour}\\times24\\text{ hours/day}=21,600\\text{ breaths/day}$\n2. **Estimate breaths in two weeks**:\n    - Breaths in two weeks $=21,600\\text{ breaths/day}\\times14\\text{ days}=302,400\\text{ breaths}$\n3. **Estimate air volume per person**:\n    - Air volume $=302,400\\text{ breaths}\\times\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ L/breath}=151,200\\text{ L}$\n4. **Estimate air volume for multiple people**:\n    - Let's assume the space station needs to accommodate 3 people.\n    - Total air volume for 3 people $=151,200\\text{ L}\\times3 = 453,600\\text{ L}$\n5. **Convert air volume to cubic meters**:\n    - Total air volume $=453,600\\text{ L}\\times(1\\text{ m}^3/1000\\text{ L}) = 453.6\\text{ m}^3$\n    - Explanation: Therefore, the space station should have a volume of at least 453.6 cubic meters to provide adequate air for two weeks.\n\n#### Problem 6: Plane Displacement\n**Given**:\n- First leg: 85 miles at $22^{\\circ}$ north of east\n- Second leg: 115 miles at $48^{\\circ}$ south of east\n\n**Solution**:\n1. **Resolve the first leg into components**:\n    - East - component $=85\\text{ miles}\\times\\cos(22^{\\circ}) = 78.7\\text{ miles}$\n    - North - component $=85\\text{ miles}\\times\\sin(22^{\\circ}) = 31.9\\text{ miles}$\n2. **Resolve the second leg into components**:\n    -

    "answer": "Step 1\nThe final velocities of steel ball and the steel block are measured from the principle of conservation of linear momentum and the conservation of kinetic energy.\nLet the ball strikes the block with an initial velocity $u_1$ and the ball moves with a final velocity of $v_1$. Initially, the block is stationary and therefore the initial velocity of the steel block is equal to zero, $u_2 = 0$.\nThe block moves with a final velocity $v_2$ immediately after the collision.\nThe magnitudes of $v_1$ and $v_2$ are calculated by the principles of conservation of momentum and kinetic energy.\nExplanation:\nThe sum of the momentum of ball and that of the block before the collision is equal to the sum of the momentum after the collision. This is stated according to the conservation of linear momentum.\nAnd the sum of their kinetic energy before and after the collision will also be equal according to the conservation of kinetic energy.\n\nStep 2\nThe mass of the ball $m_1 = 0.370\\mathrm{kg}$\nThe mass of the block $m_2 = 3.60\\mathrm{kg}$\nAccording to the conservation of linear momentum: $m_1u_1 + m_2u_2=m_1v_1 + m_2v_2$\nAccording to the conservation of kinetic energy: $\\frac{1}{2}m_1u_1^{2}+\\frac{1}{2}m_2u_2^{2}=\\frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^{2}+\\frac{1}{2}m_2v_2^{2}$\nSolving the two expressions for determining the final velocities,\n$v_1=\\frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\\times u_1+\\frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\\times u_2$\n$v_2=\\frac{2m_1}{m_1 + m_2}\\times u_1+\\frac{m_2 - m_1}{m_1 + m_2}\\times u_2$\nAs the initial velocity of the block is equal to zero, $u_2 = 0$;\n$v_1=\\frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\\times u_1$\nAnd $v_2=\\frac{2m_1}{m_1 + m_2}\\times u_1$\n\nStep 3\nThe masses of the ball and that of the block are known but the initial velocity of the ball is a unknown quantity.\nThe initial velocity of the ball is then calculated from the law of conservation of mechanical energy.\nExplanation:\nThe ball is fastened by connecting to the end of a string. Initially, the ball is kept in the horizontal direction and then released. The ball falls down from a height which is equal to the length of the string. Then the gravitational potential energy of the ball is completely transformed into kinetic energy when it strikes the block.\n$\\frac{1}{2}m_1u_1^{2}=m_1gh$\n$u_1^{2}=2gh$\n$h = L=50\\mathrm{cm}=0.50\\mathrm{m}$\n$g=$acceleration due to gravity $ = 9.8\\mathrm{m/s}^{2}$\nSubstituting the values of the height and the acceleration due to gravity,\n$u_1^{2}=2\\times9.8\\times0.50 = 9.8$\n$u_1=\\sqrt{9.8}\\mathrm{m/s}$\n$u_1 = 3.131\\mathrm{m/s}$\n\nStep 4\nCalculations for the final velocities:\n$u_1 = 3.131\\mathrm{m/s}$ and $u_2 = 0$\n$m_1 = 0.370\\mathrm{kg}$ and $m_2 = 3.60\\mathrm{kg}$\nThe final velocity of the steel ball:\n$v_1=\\frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\\times u_1$\n$v_1=\\frac{0.370 - 3.60}{0.370+3.60}\\times3.131\\mathrm{m/s}$\n$v_1=\\frac{- 3.23}{3.97}\\times3.131\\mathrm{m/s}$\n$v_1=- 0.814\\times3.131\\mathrm{m/s}$\n$v_1=- 2.5486\\mathrm{m/s}$\n$v_1=- 2.60\\mathrm{m/s}$\nThe final velocity of the steel block:\n$v_2=\\frac{2m_1}{m_1 + m_2}\\times u_1$\n$v_2=\\frac{2\\times0.370}{0.370 + 3.60}\\times3.131\\mathrm{m/s}$\n$v_2=\\frac{0.74}{3.97}\\times3.131\\mathrm{m/s}$\n$v_2 = 0.1864\\times3.131\\mathrm{m/s}$\n$v_2 = 0.584\\mathrm{m/s}$\n\nAnswer\nThe final velocity of the steel ball: $v_1=- 2.60\\mathrm{m/s}$\nThe final velocity of the steel block: $v_2 = 0.584\\mathrm{m/s}$\nThe final velocity of the ball is calculated as a negative value. It means, the ball is moving in the negative horizontal direction, towards left.\nThe final velocity of the block is a positive value. It shows that the steel block is moving towards right."

    "answer": "**Step 1**\nApply Kirchhoff's current law at point P.\nThe current $I$ coming from the battery $V$ then it passes through $R_3$ and gets divided on two - resistor $R_1$ and $R_2$. Let the current passing through $R_1$ is $I_1$ and the current passing through $R_2$ is $I_2$.\n$\\Rightarrow I_1 + I_2=I\\quad(1)$\nApply Kirchhoff's voltage rule in the right - loop:\n$-V_1 + V-V_3 = 0$\n$\\Rightarrow -I_1R_1+V - IR_3 = 0$\n$\\Rightarrow I_1R_1+IR_3 = V$\n$I_1R_1=(V - IR_3)$\n$I_1=\\frac{V - IR_3}{R_1}\\quad(2)$\nSimilarly, apply Kirchhoff's voltage rule in the left - loop:\n$-V_2 + V-V_3 = 0$\n$\\Rightarrow -I_2R_2+V - IR_3 = 0$\n$\\Rightarrow I_2R_2+IR_3 = V$\n$I_2=\\frac{V - IR_3}{R_2}\\quad(3)$\n\n**Explanation**:\nAccording to Kirchhoff's voltage rule, the sum of potential drop in the loop will be zero. When the direction of the current is the same as the direction of the loop then potential drop through the resistor will be negative but direction of loop is opposite to the direction of current then potential drop through the resistor will be positive. The potential of the battery is taken as positive when the loop direction is passing from negative terminal to positive terminal. (In both loop directions are passing from negative to positive terminal). But if it is opposite then take potential drop through the battery is negative.\n\n**Step 2**\nAdd the total current from equation (2) and (3).\n$I_1 + I_2=I$\n$\\frac{V - IR_3}{R_1}+\\frac{V - IR_3}{R_2}=I$\n$\\frac{VR_2-IR_3R_2 + VR_1-IR_1R_2}{R_1R_2}=I$\n$V(R_1 + R_2)-I(R_3R_2+R_3R_1)=IR_1R_2$\n$V(R_1 + R_2)=IR_1R_2+I(R_3R_2 + R_3R_1)$\n$V(R_1 + R_2)=I(R_1R_2+R_3(R_1 + R_2))$\n$V=\\frac{I(R_1R_2+R_3(R_1 + R_2))}{(R_1 + R_2)}$\n$V=(I\\frac{R_1R_2}{R_1 + R_2}+R_3)$\n$\\frac{V}{\\frac{R_1R_2}{R_1 + R_2}+R_3}=I$\n(This equation shows that the current passing through the battery and third resistor).\nBut the net current passing through the battery is potential of the battery divided by equivalent resistance of the circuit.\n$I = \\frac{V}{R_{eq}}$\n$\\Rightarrow R_{eq}=\\frac{R_1R_2}{R_1 + R_2}+R_3$\n$\\Rightarrow R_{eq}=R'+R_3\\quad(R'=\\frac{R_1R_2}{R_1 + R_2})$\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe equivalent resistance in series combination is simply the sum of individual resistances of each resistor, and the equivalent resistance in parallel combination of resistor is given by formula ($R_1$ and $R_2$ be parallel, $\\frac{1}{R'}=\\frac{1}{R_1}+\\frac{1}{R_2}\\Rightarrow R'=\\frac{R_1R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$).\nSo it can be said that the resistor $R_1$ and $R_2$ are in parallel combination.

    "difficulty": 5,
    "answer": "**Solution**:\nTo solve these questions, we will use concepts from electrostatics.\na. What is the potential at point P, the centroid of the triangle?\nThe electric potential $V$ at a point due to a point - charge ($q$) is given by:\n$V=\\frac{kq}{r}$\nwhere $k = 8.99\\times10^{9}\\,N\\cdot\\frac{m^{2}}{C^{2}}$ is Coulomb's constant, ($q$) is the charge, and ($r$) is the distance from the charge to the point.\nSince the point $P$ is the centroid of the triangle, all charges are equidistant from $P$. We will calculate the potential at $P$ due to each charge and then sum these potentials.\nb. What is the electric potential energy stored in the 3 - charge system?\nThe electric potential energy ($U$) of a system of charges is given by:\n$U=\\frac{kq_1q_2}{r_{12}}+\\frac{kq_1q_3}{r_{13}}+\\frac{kq_2q_3}{r_{23}}$\nwhere $r_{ij}$ is the distance between charges ($q_i$) and ($q_j$).\nFor an isosceles triangle, ($r_{12}=a$), ($r_{13}=b$), and ($r_{23}=a$).\nc. How much work must an external agent do to exchange the positions of ($q_1$) and ($q_3$)?\nThe work done to exchange two charges is the change in the potential energy of the system due to the exchange. Since the potential energy depends on the product of the charges and their distances, if we exchange the positions of two charges, the distances between pairs of charges do not change, so the total potential energy of the system remains unchanged. Therefore, the work done by an external agent is zero.\nd. How much work must an external agent do to exchange the positions of ($q_1$) and ($q_2$)?\nSimilarly, when exchanging ($q_1$) and ($q_2$), the total potential energy remains unchanged, so the work done by an external agent would again be zero.\nHowever, to ensure clarity and correctness, let's perform the calculations step - by - step. Starting with part (a), calculating the potential at point $P$. Then, we'll calculate the stored electric potential energy for part (b), and re - confirm the work required for parts (c) and (d). Let's start with part (a).\nThe electric potential at point $P$, the centroid of the triangle, at a distance of $3.5$ cm from the base, is approximately $5,137,143$ volts.\n\n**Explanation**:\nIn part (a), we calculated the electric potential at point $P$ by adding together the potentials contributed by each of the three charges. Each charge contributes to the total potential at $P$ according to the formula $V = \\frac{kq}{r}$, where ($k$) is Coulomb's constant, ($q$) is the charge, and ($r$) is the distance from the charge to point $P$. Since $P$ is the centroid of the triangle, all charges are the same distance from $P$, simplifying our calculation. The sum of these potentials gives the total electric potential at $P$, which we found to be approximately $5,137,143$ volts.\nThis high value results from the significant magnitude of the charges and the relatively short distance from each charge to point $P$.\n\n**Step 2**:\nNow let's calculate the electric potential energy stored in the 3 - charge system for part (b).\nThe electric potential energy stored in the 3 - charge system is approximately $- 26.97\\,J$ (joules).\nFor parts (c) and (d), as previously explained, the work required to exchange the positions of any two charges in this system would theoretically be zero because the system's total potential energy doesn't change solely due to positional swaps between charges. However, this assumes an ideal scenario without considering any path - dependent forces or external fields. But let's clarify if this understanding remains valid under standard electrostatic assumptions.\nUnder standard electrostatic assumptions, the work required by an external agent to exchange the positions of two charges in the system does not change the system's electrostatic potential energy. Therefore:\nc. The work required to exchange the positions of ($q_1$) and ($q_3$) is zero, because the total electrostatic potential energy of the system before and after the exchange remains the same.\nd. Similarly, the work required to exchange the positions of ($q_1$) and ($q_2$) is also zero for the same reason.\nIn electrostatics, the work done in moving charges around is stored as potential energy only if it results in a change in the system's total potential energy.\n\n**Explanation**:\nIn part (b), we calculated the electric potential energy of the three - charge system using the formula that combines the products of each pair of charges divided by their distances. The negative value indicates that there is an attractive interaction between some of the charges.\nFor parts (c) and (d), the theoretical work required to exchange positions of any two change is zero because this operation does not change the overall configuration's distances between charges, hence no change in the system's total electrostatic potential energy. This means that, under ideal conditions without external forces, moving charges around in such a manner does not require energy as long as it does not alter the system's total potential energy.\n\n**Answer**:\n**Final answer**:\nIn summary, for the electrostatic problems discussed:\n- The electric potential at point $P$, the centroid of the triangle, due to the three charges is calculated to be approximately $5,137,143$ volts, based on the principle that potential is additive and independent of the sign of the charges.\n- The total electric potential energy stored within the system of three charges is approximately $-26.97\\,J$, which results from the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.\n- The work required to exchange positions of any two charges (either ($q_1$) with ($q_3$) or ($q_1$) with ($q_2$)) is zero under electrostatic assumptions, as such exchanges do not alter the system's total potential energy."

    "answer": "**Step 1**\n(a) Electron Drift Velocity and Hall Current Density\n1. Electron Motion:\nThe electrons within the plasma experience two forces:\nElectric force: $\\mathbf{F_e}=-e\\mathbf{E}$ (course along $\\mathbf{E}$, down - wards)\nMagnetic force: $\\mathbf{F_m}=-e\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}$ (perpendicular to both $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$, because of proper - hand rule)\nSince there may be no net pressure on the electrons inside the steady country, we will write:\n$\\mathbf{F_e}+\\mathbf{F_m}=0$\n$-e\\mathbf{E}+(-e\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}) = 0$\n2. Solving for Drift Velocity:\n$-e(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}) = 0$\n$\\mathbf{v}=-\\frac{\\mathbf{E}}{\\mathbf{B}}$\nHowever, the electron speed is not truly alongside $\\mathbf{E}$ however additionally has a aspect due to the magnetic discipline.\nExplanation:\nThis thing is perpendicular to $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$, ensuing in a waft speed inside the axial direction. To account for this, we observe that the magnetic force also reasons the electrons to curl across the cylinder.\nThis curling movement does no longer affect the net pressure, but it does contribute to the drift velocity.\nTherefore, the flow speed is: $\\mathbf{v_{drift}}=\\frac{\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^{2}}$\n\n**Step 2**\n3. Hall Current Density:\nThe Hall modern - day density is the cutting - edge carried via the drifting electrons. Since the electrons have a negative price, the present day density is:\n$\\mathbf{j_{Hall}}=-n_e e\\mathbf{v_{drift}}=-n_e e\\frac{\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^{2}}$\nExplanation:\nTherefore, the electrons flow at a regular velocity $\\mathbf{v_{drift}}=\\frac{\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^{2}}$, and this float creates a Hall current density $\\mathbf{j_{Hall}}=-n_e e\\frac{\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^{2}}$.\n\n**Step 3**\n(b) Net Thrust and Lorentz Force on Ions\n1. Net Thrust:\nThe Lorentz force acting on a shifting charge in a magnetic discipline is given with the aid of $\\mathbf{F}=q\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}$. In this situation, the ions are transferring in the radial path (because of the electric field) and revel in a Lorentz force in the azimuthal course.\nSince the ions are ejected from the cylinder, the Lorentz pressure on them creates a internet force, which in keeping with Newton's 3rd law, exerts an identical and opposite pressure on the cylinder walls, resulting in a thrust in the contrary route (axial course).\nThis thrust can be calculated via integrating the Lorentz pressure over the cylindrical surfaces and contemplating the present day density and magnetic area distribution. The result is:\n$\\mathbf{T}=\\mathbf{B}\\times\\mathbf{j_{Hall}}$\nTherefore, the cylindrical shells enjoy a internet thrust because of the interaction between the Hall modern and the magnetic field.\nExplanation:\n2. Lorentz Force on Ions:\nThe Lorentz pressure also acts on the ions, however it does not without delay make a contribution to the thrust. Since the ions are ejected radially, the Lorentz pressure does now not change their net momentum within the axial route. However, it does have an effect on the trajectory of the ions, inflicting them to spiral around the cylinder axis as they're ejected.\n\n**Answer**\nTherefore,\nElectrons drift in the axial route with a consistent speed $\\mathbf{v_{drift}}=\\frac{\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^{2}}$.\nThis go with the flow creates a Hall modern density $\\mathbf{j_{Hall}}=-n_e e\\frac{\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^{2}}$.\nThe Hall current and the magnetic area have interaction to create a net thrust $\\mathbf{T}=\\mathbf{B}\\times\\mathbf{j_{Hall}}$ at the cylindrical shells.\nThe Lorentz force acts at the ions however does not directly contribute to the thrust.

    "answer": "**Step 1**\nIntroduction: Two blocks, connected by a mass - less rope over a frictionless pulley, are released. Block 1 (mass ($M_1$)) sits on a frictionless table, while Block 2 (mass ($M_2$)) hangs vertically. Determine the relationship between the tension in the rope and the weights of the blocks.\nExplanation: The resistive force that prevents two surfaces in contact from moving is known as friction. It depends on the characteristics of the surfaces and their relative motion and acts parallel to the surface.\n\n**Step 2**\nSolution:\nTwo blocks are connected by a rope and are free to move, with Block 1 on a frictionless surface and Block 2 hanging vertically. Since Block 2 is hanging and Block 1 is able to move, the system will accelerate due to the gravitational force acting on Block 2.\n1. This is not true. If the system is accelerating, the tension in the rope must be less than the weight of Block 2 because the net force on Block 2 is what causes it to accelerate.\n2. This is not true. The tension cannot be greater than the weight of Block 2 because Block 2 would then accelerate upward, which doesn't match the setup.\n3. This is true. Block 2 is accelerating downward, meaning the tension is less than the weight of Block 2.\n4. This is not true. Since Block 1 is on a frictionless table and the system is accelerating, the tension is related to the force required to accelerate Block 1, which is less than its weight (since the weight of Block 1 doesn't directly contribute to horizontal motion).\n5. This is not true. The tension only causes horizontal motion for Block 1, and the weight of Block 1 doesn't play a direct role in this motion because of the frictionless surface.\n6. This is true. The tension accelerates Block 1 horizontally, but Block 1’s weight (which acts vertically) doesn't directly affect this tension.\n7. This is not true. The tension will always be less than the weight of Block 2, regardless of which block has a larger mass. The acceleration and tension are determined by the system’s dynamics, not just which block is heavier.\nExplanation: When forces operating from opposite ends pull a string, rope, or cable taut, tension is the pulling force communicated through the material, usually throughout its length.\n\n**Answer**\nConclusion:\nCorrect Statements is,\nThe tension is less than the weight of Block 2.\nThe tension is less than the weight of Block 1."

    "answer": "**Solution**\n\n**Step 1**\n1: Describe the Motion in Each Segment\nFirst Segment (Upward Slope): The person moves away from the reference point (starting position) at a constant speed. This is a steady increase in distance from the origin.\nSecond Segment (Flat Line): The person stops moving and stays at this position for some time. The position does not change.\nThird Quarter (Decline): The individual returns to the reference point, slowing down as the slope declines.\nExplanation:\nIn this step we can describe the Motion in Each Segment. Here the graph shows movement away from the origin stopping briefly and then returning toward the starting point.\n\n**Step 2**\n2: Important Observations Regarding the Motion\nInitial Position: The story starts at position 0 (the reference point).\nFinal Position: The individual ends up back at the starting position (position 0).\nWhen They Stop: In the flat part of the curve, the individual stops to take a break..\nSpeed Comparison: The speed is constant both in the beginning and the last part of the piece; it was slower in the last part as suggested by the less steep slope.\nExplanation:\nIn this step we can make Important Observations Regarding the Motion. Here the motion begins and ends at the same point. The person stops briefly, with speed differing in each segment.\n\n**Step 3**\n3: Summary of Story\nA person walks from home to a park, walking steadily (upward slope). They stop at the park to rest (flat line). Then, they return home, moving slower as they tire (downward slope). The journey begins and ends at the same spot.\nExplanation:\nHere in this step we can give Summary. A person walks away pauses at a destination and returns at a slower pace completing their journey.\n\n**Answer**\nA man leaves from his house (with the point of reference). At first, he moves away steadily and covers some distance (Segment 1). Then, he stops momentarily and remains stationary at a given point (Segment 2). He then begins to walk back to his house but at a reduced speed than in the first instance (Segment 3). He eventually makes it back to the point where he started."

    "difficulty": 5,
    "answer": "** - **Introduction**\nThis problem is related to finding the net electric force on a charge of +e kept at the apex of an equilateral triangle where two negative charges lie at the base - corners. Coulomb's Law is used here whereby three charges and their magnitudes, in conjunction with the distances that separate them, determine the force between them. The length of a side of the triangle here is 5 cm, making punctuality quite valuable in simplifying our calculations.\nExplanation:\nEach negative charge on the equilateral - triangle perceives an attractive force to the positive charge. Since our geometry is of great importance, there is a horizontal and vertical component of these forces. The horizontal components being in opposite direction, their magnitudes act the same. This completely zeroes the force out in this direction, leaving only the vertical components to contribute to net force. By viewing components of the same forces and summing the vertical contribution, we will find the total force.\n\n**2nd step** - **Apply Coulomb's Law**\nThe electric force between two charges is given by:\n$F = k\\frac{\\vert q_1q_2\\vert}{r^{2}}$\nwhere:\n- $k = 8.99\\times10^{9}\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C^{2}}$ is Coulomb's constant,\n- $q_1,q_2$ are the magnitudes of the charges,\n- $r$ is the distance between the charges.\nFor the charges in this problem:\n- $q_1= + e=1.6\\times10^{-19}\\ C$\n- $q_2=-2e = - 3.2\\times10^{-19}\\ C$\n- $r = 5cm=0.05m$\nThe force between the positive charge +e and each negative charge - 2e is:\n$F = k\\frac{\\vert(+e)( - 2e)\\vert}{r^{2}}=\\frac{8.99\\times10^{9}\\cdot(1.6\\times10^{-19})\\cdot(3.2\\times10^{-19})}{(0.05)^{2}}$\nSimplify:\n$F=\\frac{8.99\\times10^{9}\\cdot5.12\\times10^{-38}}{0.0025}=\\frac{4.6\\times10^{-28}}{0.0025}=1.84\\times10^{-25}\\ N$\nEach negative charge exerts a force of $1.84\\times10^{-25}N$ on the positive charge.\n\n**Resolve Forces into Components**\n- The force between +e and the left - 2e charge acts along the line connecting these charges. This force can be resolved into:\n  - Horizontal component: $F_x = F\\cos(30^{\\circ})$\n  - Vertical component: $F_y = F\\sin(30^{\\circ})$\nSimilarly, the force from the right - 2e charge is resolved into:\n  - Horizontal component: $F_x = F\\cos(30^{\\circ})$\n  - Vertical component: $F_y = F\\sin(30^{\\circ})$\nUsing trigonometric values: $\\cos(30^{\\circ})=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, $\\sin(30^{\\circ})=\\frac{1}{2}$\nFor the left - 2e charge:\n$F_{x1}=1.84\\times10^{-25}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, $F_{y1}=1.84\\times10^{-25}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}$\nFor the right - 2e charge:\n$F_{x2}=1.84\\times10^{-25}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, $F_{y2}=1.84\\times10^{-25}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}$\n\n**Calculate Net Force**\n**Horizontal components (Fx):**\nThe horizontal components cancel each other because they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:\n$F_{net,x}=F_{x1}-F_{x2}=0$\n**Vertical components (Fy):**\nThe vertical components add up because they act in the same direction:\n$F_{net,y}=F_{y1}+F_{y2}$\nSubstituting values:\n$F_{net,y}=2\\cdot F\\cdot\\sin(30^{\\circ})=2\\cdot1.84\\times10^{-25}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}$\n$F_{net,y}=1.84\\times10^{-25}\\ N$\nThe net force is purely vertical, with a magnitude of $1.84\\times10^{-25}\\ N$.\n\n**Explanation**\nThe magnitude of the net force is calculated to be $1.84\\times10^{-25}\\ N$ purely in the vertical direction (downward). However, this symmetry stops the computation from becoming complex since it brings about the reduced multidimensional problem to only one effective force component.\n\n**Answer**\nThe final downward - vertical net force acted upon charge +e is $1.84\\times10^{-25}\\ N$.

    "difficulty": 3,
    "answer": "Step 1\nIntroduction\nThis problem consists in considering two masses tied up together by a rope that passes over a frictionless pulley. The first mass with weight 3m hangs vertically while the supporting block is also on a friction incline of 30 degrees; whose weight is still mg and that is where friction comes in with a coefficient of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$. The system is at rest, with the target of solving the velocity at which m1 will hit the ground when it falls from a height of 7m. The forces acting on the masses are gravity, tension, and friction. Their actions on the masses tell the system acceleration.\nExplanation:\nAs for the forces inside m2 along the incline, the gravitational pull on m2 is $W + f=0$, which means it plays no role in the net force itself. M1, on the other hand, is being driven by gravity, which accelerates the system. The acceleration is the result of the total mass of both objects. In turn, m2 is restricted by the incline, leaving m1's fall as a judgment criterion for the behavior of the overall system.\n\nStep 2\n1. Analyze the forces on the system:\n   - For $m1 = 3m$ (hanging mass):\n     - Downward force due to gravity: $Fg1=m1g = 3mg$.\n   - For $m2 = 2m$ (mass on the incline):\n     - Gravitational force along the incline: $F_{gravity, incline}=m2g\\sin\\theta=2mg\\sin(30^{\\circ})=mg$.\n     - Frictional force opposing motion: $F_{gravity, incline}=mg\\sin\\theta = 2mg\\sin(30^{\\circ})=mg$.\nThus, the net force on m2 is:\n$F_{net, incline}=mg - F_{friction}=mg - mg = 0$.\n2. Net force on the system:\nThe only net force causing acceleration is due to m1, as the forces on m2 cancel out.\nThe net force is:\n$F_{net}=F_{g1}-F_{friction}=3mg - mg = 2mg$.\n3. Acceleration of the system:\nThe total mass of the system is $m1 + m2=3m+2m = 5m$. Using Newton's second - law:\n$F_{net}=(m1 + m2)a\\Rightarrow2mg = 5ma$.\n$a=\\frac{2g}{5}$.\n4. Determine the final velocity:\nThe system starts from rest, so the initial velocity (u) is 0. The height of m1 is $h = 7m$.\nUsing the kinematic equation:\n$v^{2}=u^{2}+2as$,\nwhere $s = h = 7m$, $u = 0$, and $a=\\frac{2g}{5}$:\n$v^{2}=0 + 2\\cdot\\frac{2g}{5}\\cdot7$.\n$v^{2}=\\frac{28g}{5}$.\n$v=\\sqrt{\\frac{28g}{5}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{28\\cdot10}{5}}=\\sqrt{56}=2\\sqrt{14}$.\nExplanation:\nSo using the acceleration calculated before and the initial condition, the kinematics of the system can be employed to find the velocity of m1 just before hitting the ground. The falling object ensures that m2 displaces on the incline, keeping a constant relationship between the masses. Uniform acceleration equals a velocity that would be derived in terms of the distance fallen by m1.\n\nAnswer\nThe speed of the object of mass m1 just before hitting the ground is: $4\\sqrt{10}m/s$."

    "answer": "Step 1\nDetermine the charge on the outer surface of the hollow conductor when the conductor has a net charge of +1 nC.\nStep 1: Analyze the total charge of the conducting shell\nThe total charge of the conducting shell is given as +1 nC. This total charge is distributed between:\n1. The inner surface of the conductor (to cancel the electric field due to the charge inside the cavity).\n2. The outer surface of the conductor (to account for the net charge on the shell).\nStep 2: Use Gauss's Law for the cavity\nInside the cavity is a charge of -5 nC. The conductor must induce a charge on its inner surface such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. By Gauss's law, this induced charge must be:\n$Q_{inner}=-Q_{cavity}= + 5\\ nC$\nThis ensures that the total charge inside the Gaussian surface enclosing the cavity is zero.\nStep 3: Compute the charge on the outer surface\nThe total charge on the conductor is the sum of the charges on the inner and outer surfaces:\n$Q_{total}=Q_{inner}+Q_{outer}$\nSubstitute the known values:\n$1\\ nC = 5\\ nC+Q_{outer}$\nSolve for $Q_{outer}$:\n$Q_{outer}=1\\ nC - 5\\ nC=-4\\ nC$\nExplanation:\nThe electric field in the cavity is cancelled by the inner surface so the conductor ensures that. We see that the charge on the inner surface accounts for what remains of the charge +1 nC required by the entire charge of the conductor. As a result we have the outer - surface charges equal to -4 nC.\n\nStep 2\nDetermine the charge on the inner surface of the cavity when the conductor has a net charge of +1 nC.\nStep 1: Apply Gauss's Law inside the cavity\nInside the cavity is a negative charge of -5 nC. Therefore, it is required so that the inner surface of the conductor induces a charge inside the cavity, so that the charge inside the cavity and the charge induced on the inner surface of the conductor compensated each other, the amount of charge induced on the inner surface of the conductor is equal to the amount of charge inside the cavity. Using Gauss's law:\n$Q_{inner}=-Q_{cavity}= + 5\\ nC$\nExplanation:\nThis charge on the inner surface of the conductor neutralises the charge in the cavity. This assuages us that the electric field in the conductor is zero, which is to be so of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium.\n\nAnswer\nFinal answer:\n1.

    "answer": "**Step 1**\n- **Explanation**:\n    - This problem is solved using Newton's second - law on a mass subjected to a spring.\n    - The diagram of this exercise shows a mass $m$ attached to a spring. The mass block only moves horizontally. Consider this as the $x$ - axis. Two forces act on the mass block: an elastic force due to the spring and a damping force due to the medium in which the mass block moves. According to Newton's second - law, $ma_x=-kx - bv$, where the first term on the right - hand side is Hooke's law that models the force due to a spring and the second term is the damping force given in the statement.\n\n**Step 2**\n- **Explanation**:\n    - Write Newton's second - law as a differential equation.\n    - Since $a_x=\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}$ and $v = \\frac{dx}{dt}$, then $ma_x=-kx - bv$ can be rewritten as $m\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}+b\\frac{dx}{dt}+kx = 0$. The differential equation to be solved is $\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}+\\frac{b}{m}\\frac{dx}{dt}+\\frac{k}{m}x = 0$\n\n**Step 3**\n- **Explanation**:\n    - Solve the differential equation to determine the angular frequency of the motion.\n    - Given $m = 0.5kg$, $b = 0.662\\frac{kg}{s}$, $k = 41\\frac{N}{m}$, the differential equation $\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}+\\frac{b}{m}\\frac{dx}{dt}+\\frac{k}{m}x = 0$ becomes $\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}+(\\frac{0.662}{0.5}\\frac{1}{s})\\frac{dx}{dt}+(\\frac{41}{0.5}\\frac{1}{s^{2}})x = 0$, i.e., $\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}+(1.324\\frac{1}{s})\\frac{dx}{dt}+(82\\frac{1}{s^{2}})x = 0$ or $\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}+(1.324)\\frac{dx}{dt}+(82)x = 0$\n    - Assume a solution of the form $x(t)=e^{\\lambda t}$, then we get the characteristic equation $\\lambda^{2}+\\frac{331}{250}\\lambda + 82=0$\n    - Solving for $\\lambda$, $\\lambda=-\\frac{331}{500}\\pm i9.03$\n    - The solution is $x(t)=c_1e^{-\\frac{331}{500}t}\\cos(9.03t)+c_2e^{-\\frac{331}{500}t}\\sin(9.03t)$\n    - From this result, the angular frequency $\\omega$ is extracted from the argument of the trigonometric functions, $\\omega = 9.03\\frac{1}{s}$\n\n**Answer**\n- It is found using Newton's second - law that the angular frequency of the damped system is $\\omega = 9.03\\frac{1}{s}$\n![](images/139717839_0022b00761b0a6878aa17f74e0c0d5317b37dbe1ea670687d7c4836356b284eb.jpg)"

    "answer": "**Step 1**\nWhen the light from the candle passes directly through the lens:\nFrom the figure it is clear that the image (I) is real and inverted with respect to the original object.\nThe object i.e. the candle is at 85cm from the optical center of the lens having focal length 32cm.\nSo the candle is far away from the twice of focal length ($2f = 2\\times32 = 64$ cm).\nExplanation:\nIn this situation the image of the object form always real and inverted.\n\n**Step 2**\nLet consider the distance of the image of the candle is $v$ from the optical center. Applying the formula:\n$\\frac{1}{v}-\\frac{1}{u}=\\frac{1}{f}$\n$\\Rightarrow\\frac{1}{v}-\\frac{1}{- 85}=\\frac{1}{32}$\n$\\Rightarrow\\frac{1}{v}=\\frac{1}{32}-\\frac{1}{85}$\n$= 0.0194852$\n$\\Rightarrow v = 51.32$ cm\nExplanation:\nHere $u$ is the distance of candle from the lens $= 85$cm.\n\n**Step 3**\nFrom the ray - diagram, the Image - 1 due to the concave mirror is located at same position where the original candle is placed.\nWhen the object is placed in front of mirror at center of curvature, image will always form with the object but in inverted direction. It is happen due to radius of curvature is twice the focal length of the concave mirror i.e. $r = 2f'$\nExplanation:\nwhere $f'$ is the focal length of the concave mirror\n\n**Step 4**\nThe Image - 1 is behave like an virtual object to the lens and final image will form by the lens at the right side of the mirror.\nThe position of the virtual object is $u = 85$cm, so the final image also formed at 51.32~cm.\nExplanation\nApplying the formula $\\frac{1}{v}-\\frac{1}{u}=\\frac{1}{f}$, it will get same result as we previously done in step - (1).\nHere the value of $u$ must be $-85$cm because the image - 1 or the virtual object is left side of the mirror.\nThe final image must be a real image and erect with respect to the original object.\nThe final image is erect to the original image because the virtual image is already inverted so the final image is inverted to the virtual object,\nExplanation:\nso over all the final image is erect to the original object.\n\n**Answer**\nWhen the light directly passes through the lens, the image will form at 51.32 cm right to the lens. The image is real and inverted with respect to the original candle.\nWhen the light first reflected by the concave mirror and then passes through the lens, the image will form also at 51.32 cm right to the lens and the image is erect with respect to the candle but the image is real."

    "answer": "**Step 1**\n\nHere we are given a typical case of projectile - motion in which the projectile is an apple.\n\n**Explanation**:\n\nIn projectile motion, the velocity vector of the projectile changes continuously as it moves through its trajectory. At any given point, the velocity vector consists of two components: horizontal velocity ($v_x$) and vertical velocity ($v_y$).\n\nThe below diagram shows the direction of velocity at each point.\n\nAs we can see that it has both x and y components of velocity at every point except at the top - most point where the vertical component of velocity becomes zero.\n\nNote that the value of $v$ is not same at every point. It continuously changes and becomes minimum at the top - most point.\n\n**Step 2**\n\nLet's talk about the acceleration in this motion.\n\n**Explanation**:\n\nIn projectile motion, the acceleration of the projectile is due to the gravitational force acting vertically downward. Since there are no horizontal forces acting on the projectile (assuming no air resistance), the horizontal component of acceleration is zero. The vertical component of acceleration ($a_y$) is simply the acceleration due to gravity ($g$), which is approximately $9.81m/s^2$ near the Earth's surface. The acceleration due to gravity causes the vertical velocity of the projectile to change continuously, accelerating it downward.\n\nTherefore, in projectile motion, the acceleration can be expressed as:\n$a_x = 0$\n$a_y=-g$\n\nWhere:\n- $a_x$ is the horizontal component of acceleration.\n- $a_y$ is the vertical component of acceleration.\n- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nHere there will be only vertical acceleration be present and it points in the downward direction at every point on the motion.\n\n**Answer**\n\nWe have drawn both the velocity vectors and the acceleration vectors at every point.\n![](images/145339101_d241ee19847dc9773388d2dc5848ffe8b81087816f1f56f8a448316cb7f4895c.jpg)\n![](images/145339101_bf2f5e859d4fa435bb7d83e57f240e3ed397e3f7ae8987f2e75918956d37d80e.jpg)"

    "question": "Spheres, with masses $m$ and $3m$, are connected by a rod of negligible mass, as shown. Three rotational axes are labeled in the figure. Axis B passes through the center of mass of the spheres - rod system, which is represented by the dot, and axes A and C are both a distance $d$ from Axis B. If the same torque is exerted on the system as it rotates about each of the three axes, which of the following correctly compares the angular accelerations $\\alpha_A$, $\\alpha_B$, and $\\alpha_C$ of the spheres - rod system about axes A, B, and C, respectively?\n1. Recall the rotational - dynamics equation $\\tau = I\\alpha$, where $\\tau$ is the torque, $I$ is the moment of inertia, and $\\alpha$ is the angular acceleration. For a given torque $\\tau$, the angular acceleration $\\alpha=\\frac{\\tau}{I}$. So, to compare the angular accelerations, we need to compare the moments of inertia about the three axes.\n   - **Calculate the moment of inertia about axis B**:\n     - The center - of - mass of the two - mass system is found using the formula $x_{cm}=\\frac{m_1x_1 + m_2x_2}{m_1 + m_2}$. Let the position of the mass $m$ be $x = 0$ and the position of the mass $3m$ be $x = L$. Then $x_{cm}=\\frac{m\\times0+3m\\times L}{m + 3m}=\\frac{3}{4}L$. Axis B passes through the center of mass.\n     - The moment of inertia about axis B, $I_B=m\\times r_1^2+3m\\times r_2^2$. Since the system is symmetric about the center - of - mass (axis B), using the fact that the two masses $m$ and $3m$ are related in such a way that if the distance of $m$ from the center of mass is $x_1$ and the distance of $3m$ from the center of mass is $x_2$, and $mx_1 = 3mx_2$ and $x_1+x_2$ is the distance between the two masses. Let the distance between the two masses be $l$. Solving the system $mx_1 = 3mx_2$ and $x_1 + x_2=l$ gives $x_1=\\frac{3}{4}l$ and $x_2=\\frac{1}{4}l$. So, $I_B=m\\times(\\frac{3}{4}l)^2+3m\\times(\\frac{1}{4}l)^2=\\frac{9}{16}ml^2+\\frac{3}{16}ml^2=\\frac{3}{4}ml^2$.\n   - **Calculate the moment of inertia about axis A and C using the parallel - axis theorem**:\n     - The parallel - axis theorem states that $I = I_{cm}+Md^2$, where $I_{cm}$ is the moment of inertia about the center - of mass, $M$ is the total mass of the system ($M=m + 3m=4m$), and $d$ is the perpendicular distance between the two axes.\n     - For axes A and C, which are at a distance $d$ from axis B (the center - of - mass axis), $I_A=I_C=I_B+(m + 3m)d^2=I_B + 4md^2$.\n2. Since $\\alpha=\\frac{\\tau}{I}$ and $\\tau$ is the same for all three axes:\n     - Because $I_A = I_C>I_B$ (from the parallel - axis theorem results), then $\\alpha_B>\\alpha_A=\\alpha_C$ (since $\\alpha$ is inversely proportional to $I$ when $\\tau$ is constant).\nSo the correct comparison is $\\alpha_B>(\\alpha_A=\\alpha_C)$.\n<image>",

That is:\n$\\alpha\\propto1/I$\nLet's compute the moments of inertia about all three axes:\n\n1. Moment of Inertia about Axis A ($I\\_A$)\nExplanation:\nFor axis A, the distances of the two masses from axis A are:\n- The sphere of mass m is at d.\n- The sphere of mass 3m is at 2d (relative to axis A).\nThe moment of inertia about axis A is:\n$I\\_A = m(d)^2+3m(2d)^2=md^2 + 3m(4d^2)=md^2+12md^2 = 13md^2$\n\nStep 2\n2.

Key Similarities:\n    - Reference Frames:\n        - In both cases we have motion relative to a moving medium (river is the medium in the case of this, wind in ether are the medium in the experiment).\n    - Geometry:\n        - In a sense the yellow boat was travelling across the river (like the arm perpendicular to the ether wind) and would have had to make adjustments in angle to get to its destination.\n        - A parallel is shown in the white boat's movement across the river current compared to the arm parallel with the ether wind.\n    - Relative Velocity:\n        - The effective velocities of the boats (with respect to the shore) are of the same order as the relative velocities of the light beams in the experiment.\n2. Significance:\n    - In both scenarios, such use of relative - motion principle is implemented to know how to perceive movement in one frame from another.\n    - In both cases the path is affected by the interaction of the moving medium (river or ether) and the observed time.\n\nAnswer\nSummary of Final Results:\n1. Speed of yellow boat relative to the water: $12.2\\ m/s$\n2. Steering angle for the yellow boat: $35^{\\circ}$\n3. Time taken by the white boat: $38.46\\ s$\n4.

    "answer": "**Step 1**\n\nA vibrating tuning fork produces a frequency $\\nu$. When one vibrates a tuning fork, the tines of the fork start moving outward and inward. This outward - inward movement is very fast and it produces a characteristic frequency. Such one outward and inward motion of the tuning fork constitutes an oscillation of the tuning fork. The amplitude of the oscillation will be smaller. Each tuning fork produces a characteristic frequency depending upon its properties. Tuning forks are of many usage in the field of acoustic physics and other branches of physics.\n\n**Explanation**:\n\nOne cycle of a tuning fork is the movement of the tines outward and inward once.\n\nAs oscillation starts from the mean position $\\text{X}$ goes to $\\text{Z}$ and then goes back through $\\text{X}$ to $\\text{Y}$ and then finally come back to $\\text{X}$. This constitutes one oscillation. It is also similar to start from $\\text{Z}$ then goes to $\\text{Y}$ and then come back to $\\text{Z}$.\n\nSo in the question we have given the time period ($T$) of the oscillation. That is the time taken by the tine of the fork to move from $\\text{Z}$ - position and ten goes back to the same position.\n\nTime period $= 1.25\\ \\text{ms}$\n\n$T = 1.25\\ \\text{ms}$\n\n**Step 2**\n\nfrequency of an oscillation $=\\frac{1}{\\text{Time period}}$\n\n$\\Rightarrow\\nu=\\frac{1}{T}$\n\n$\\nu=\\frac{1}{1.25\\times 10^{- 3}}$\n\n$\\nu = 0.8\\times10^{3}$\n\n$\\nu = 800\\ \\text{Hz}$\n\nThe frequency of fork corresponds to the given time period $\\nu = 800\\ \\text{Hz}$\n\n**Explanation**:\n\nSo the characteristic frequency of this tuning fork is $800\\ \\text{Hz}$.

    "answer": "Step 1\nIn this situation, to solve this problem, the principle of pressure equilibrium in the given system is used. The basic point - of - view here is to understand how the pressure in the general system changes depending on the pressure in the \"A\" pipe and the effects of all changes on the manometer reading.\n\nExplanation:\n\nKnown Values:\n- The pressure on the left - hand side of pipe A has decreased by 5 kPa = 5000 Pa.\n- Oil density ($\\rho_{oil}$): 850 $\\frac{kg}{m^{3}}$.\n- Mercury density ($\\rho_{mercury}$): 13,600 $\\frac{kg}{m^{3}}$.\n- Water density ($\\rho_{water}$): 998 $\\frac{kg}{m^{3}}$.\n- The initial height difference in the manometer: $h_{mercury}=50$ mm = 0.050 m.\n\nStep 1: Change in Pressure in Pipe A\nThe pressure in pipe A is given as 5000 Pa.

    "answer": "Step 1\nConceptual Introduction\nThis is the balancing problem in terms of the electrostatic forces on particle 1 exerted by other charged particles according to the Coulomb's law. The forces are vectors, so they depend on the distance between the particles and charges.\nExplanation:\nCoulomb's law is the formula that describes the force between two point - charges:\n$F = k\\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$\nwhere $k$ is the Coulomb's constant $8.99\\times10^{9}\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C^{2}}$, $q_1$ and $q_2$ are charges, and $r$ is the distance between the charges.\nIn order for the net force on the particle 1 to be zero, all the force vectors exerted on it from particles 2, 3, and 4 have to balance out each other.\n\nStep 2\nFormulas to be Used\n1. Coulomb's Law:\n$F = k\\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$\n2. Force Components: Resolve forces into $x$ - and $y$ - components:\n- $F_x = F\\cos\\theta$\n- $F_y = F\\sin\\theta$\n3. Equilibrium Condition: Net force in both $x$ - and $y$ - directions must be zero:\n$\\sum F_x = 0$, $\\sum F_y = 0$.\nExplanation:\n- The force from the particle 2 acts along the $x$ - axis.\n- The forces from the particles 3 and 4 are symmetric about the $y$ - axis, so their $x$ - components add while their $y$ - components cancel each other.\n- Balancing the $x$ - components of all forces gives us the distance $D$.\n\nStep 3\nStep - by - Step Calculations\n(a) Finding Distance D\n1. Force of Particle 2 on Particle 1:\n$F_{12}=k\\frac{q_1q_2}{D^2}$\n2. Force of Particles 3 and 4 on Particle 1: The distance between particles 1 and 3 (or 4) is $d = 2.00cm$, and the angle $\\theta = 31^{\\circ}$. The force is:\n$F_{13}=F_{14}=k\\frac{q_1q_3}{d^2}$\nThe $x$ - component of the force is:\n$F_{13x}=F_{14x}=F_{13}\\cos\\theta = k\\frac{q_1q_3}{d^2}\\cos\\theta$\nSince the forces from 3 and 4 add along $x$, the total $x$ - component is:\n$F_{34x}=2\\cdot F_{13x}=2\\cdot k\\frac{q_1q_3}{d^2}\\cos\\theta$\n3. Equilibrium in the $x$ - Direction:\nThe $x$ - components of forces must balance:\n$F_{12}=F_{34x}$\nSubstituting expressions:\n$k\\frac{q_1q_2}{D^2}=2\\cdot k\\frac{q_1q_3}{d^2}\\cos\\theta$\nSimplify:\n$\\frac{q_2}{D^2}=2\\cdot\\frac{q_3}{d^2}\\cos\\theta$\nSolve for $D^{2}$:\n$D^{2}=\\frac{q_2d^2}{2q_3\\cos\\theta}$\nValues to be substituted:\n- $q_2 = 9.60\\times10^{-19}C$,\n- $q_3=-4.80\\times10^{-19}C$,\n- $d = 2.00cm = 0.02m$,\n- $\\cos\\theta=\\cos(31^{\\circ}) = 0.857$.\n$D^{2}=\\frac{(9.60\\times10^{-19})(0.02)^{2}}{2(- 4.80\\times10^{-19})(0.857)}$\nSimplify:\n$D^{2}=\\frac{(9.60)(0.0004)}{2(4.80)(0.857)}$\n$D^{2}=\\frac{0.00384}{8.2272}$\n$D^{2}=0.0004668$\n$D=\\sqrt{0.0004668}=0.0216m = 2.16cm$\n(b) Influence of Moving Particles 3 and 4\n- If the particles 3 and 4 are moved closer to the $x$ - axis, then the angle $\\theta$ is reduced.\n- As $\\cos\\theta$ increases, the denominator in the formula for $D^{2}$ increases; thus, $D$ decreases.\n- Hence, the required $D$ would be less than $2.16cm$.\nExplanation:\nThe forces are balanced along the $x$ - axis through Coulomb's law. There is no net force along the $y$ due to the symmetry in the $y$ - direction. Reducing the angle $\\theta$, the particles 3 and 4 will contribute more force along the $x$ - component. Thus, there is a requirement for the smaller $D$ for the balancing.\n\nAnswer\nFinal Answer\n(a) $D = 2.16cm$.\n(b) The required $D$ would be less than $2.16cm$."

    "answer": "### Solution\n\n**Step 1**\n#### Theory behind the problem\nIn this problem it can easily be seen that different mechanical and electromagnetic systems and circuits are involved. A bar - conductor gliding on smooth rails in a uniform magnetic field is subjected to a force through the flow of current through it. When the switch is closed, there is a flow of current, this is given by Ohm's law ($I=\\frac{\\mathcal{E}}{R}$). The current interacts with the magnetic field ($B$) to produce a force ($F = ILB$) that moves the bar.\nWith this movement, the bar intersects the magnetic - field lines and thus the induced emf is equal to the product of the velocity of the bar, length and magnitude of the field ($\\mathcal{E}_{ind}=vLB$). However, the induced emf just like explained by Lenz's law works in the opposing direction relative to the battery's emf.\nHowever this reduces the effective emf forcing the current through the circuit to ($\\mathcal{E}_{eff}=\\mathcal{E}-\\mathcal{E}_{ind}$), hence it causes the current to reduce over time.\nAs we know, when the magnetic force acts upon a bar, the force of magnet in the bar decreases as the bar gains its speed. At some stage, the velocity increases until steady - state velocity ($v_t$) is attained at which the induced emf equals the battery emf and hence the current, and magnetic force, drops to zero.\nFrom here the bar continues to move uniformly that is there is no further acceleration of the bar. The dynamics of this system show how Faraday's law of induction works, and Lenz's law, as well as Newton's Second law of motion all in one place giving a clear view on how electric and magnetic forces counteract motion to attain balance.\n\n#### Problem Breakdown\nThis problem concerns a uniform conducting bar of mass ($m = 0.90\\ kg$) placed on two horizontal rails and experiencing the uniform magnetic field ($B = 2.4\\ T$). The system comprises the battery with emf ($\\mathcal{E}=12\\ V$) and the resistance in the circuit is ($R = 5.0\\ \\Omega$).\n\n#### Explanation\nThe bar is subjected to:\n1. A direct current coming from the battery, induce a magnetic force on the bar.\n2. An induced emf by a change in magnetic field which seeks to oppose the motion of the bar.\n\n#### The goal is to:\n1. Part A - Discuss the trend of velocity of the bar over time.\n2. Find its acceleration at the moment when an on - switch is closed (Part B).\n3. Discover how it accelerates at a specific speed (Part C).\n4. Calculate the terminal speed (Part D).\n\n#### Profile of Speed with Respect to Time\nThe bar attains a limiting velocity ($v_t$) because the force supplied by the current in the magnetic field and the back emf which is offered by the changing magnetic field.\nThe speed vs. time curve will: The correct graph is the first one which grows in an exponential fashion converging to ($v_t$). The first graph is correct.\n\n**Step 2**\n#### Part B: Acceleration Immediately After the Switch is Closed\n#### Explanation\nWhen the switch is first closed:\n- The bar is stationary ($v = 0$), so no induced emf exists.\n- The total current in the circuit is determined by Ohm's law: ($I=\\frac{\\mathcal{E}}{R}=\\frac{12}{5.0}=2.4\\ A$).\n- The magnetic force on the bar is: ($F = ILB$). Here ($L = 0.36\\ m$).\nSubstituting values: ($F=(2.4)(0.36)(2.4)=2.07\\ N$).\n- The magnetic force on the bar is: ($F = ILB$).\n- ($a=\\frac{F}{m}=\\frac{2.07}{0.90}\\approx2.30\\ m/s^{2}$).\n\n**Final Answer (Part B)**: ($a = 2.30\\ m/s^{2}$).\n\n**Step 3**\n#### Part C: Acceleration at ($v = 2.0\\ m/s$)\nAt ($v = 2.0\\ m/s$).\n#### Explanation\nThere is an induced emf ($\\mathcal{E}_{ind}$) due to the bar's motion, given by: ($\\mathcal{E}_{ind}=vLB=(2.0)(0.36)(2.4)=1.73\\ V$).\nThe net emf in the circuit is: ($\\mathcal{E}_{eff}=\\mathcal{E}-\\mathcal{E}_{ind}=12.0 - 1.73 = 10.27\\ V$).\nThe current is: ($I=\\frac{\\mathcal{E}_{eff}}{R}=\\frac{10.27}{5.0}\\approx2.05\\ A$).\nThe magnetic force is: ($F = ILB=(2.05)(0.36)(2.4)\\approx1.77\\ N$).\nThe acceleration is: ($a=\\frac{F}{m}=\\frac{1.77}{0.90}\\approx1.97\\ m/s^{2}$).\n**Final Answer (Part C)**: ($a\\approx1.97\\ m/s^{2}$).\n\n**Step 4**\n#### Part D: Terminal Speed\nAt terminal speed ($v_t$), the induced emf equals the battery emf ($\\mathcal{E}_{ind}=\\mathcal{E}$), so: ($v_tLB=\\mathcal{E}$).\nRearranging for ($v_t$): ($v_t=\\frac{\\mathcal{E}}{LB}=\\frac{12}{(0.36)(2.4)} = 13.89\\ m/s$).\n**Final Answer (Part D)**: ($v_t = 13.89\\ m/s$).\n\n### Answer\n#### Summary of Final Answers\n- Part A: The first graph is correct.\n- Part B: ($a = 2.30\\ m/s^{2}$).\n- Part C: ($a\\approx1.97\\ m/s^{2}$).\n- Part D: ($v_t = 13.89\\ m/s$)."

    "question": "While hauling a log in the back of a flatbed truck, a driver is pulled over by the state police. The police claim that the log could have slid out the back of the truck when accelerating from rest.

Regardless, the police write a ticket, and the driver's court date is approaching.\nThe log has a mass of $m = 789$ kg; the truck has a mass of $M = 9750$ kg.

The turntable is slowing down so that the speed of the coin is given by the equation $v = 6 - 2t$, in units of meters and seconds.\n### PART A\nThe coin is in the locations shown in the diagrams below at times $t = 1 s$ and $t = 2 s$. On each diagram, draw the following three vectors.

    "language": "english",
    "difficulty": 1,
    "answer": "**Step 1 - Explanation - Part A: Drawing Vectors at Time t = 1 second and t = 2 seconds**\n1. Calculate the velocity of the coin at $t = 1$ second. The velocity ($v$) is given by the equation $v=6 - 2t$.\n   - At $t = 1$ second, $v = 6-2(1)=4\\ m/s$.\n2. Calculate the tangential - acceleration ($a_t$) at $t = 1$ second. The tangential acceleration is given by the change in velocity over time. Since the velocity equation is a linear function of time, the tangential acceleration is constant and equal to the coefficient of $t$, which is $- 2\\ m/s^{2}$. This value is negative because the turntable is slowing down.\n   - So, $a_t=-2\\ m/s^{2}$ at $t = 1$ second.\n3. Calculate the centripetal acceleration ($a_c$) at $t = 1$ second. The centripetal acceleration is given by $a_c = v^{2}/r$ where $r$ is the radius of the circular path. At $t = 1$ second, $v = 4\\ m/s$ and $r = 4\\ m$, so $a_c=4^{2}/4 = 4\\ m/s^{2}$.\n4. Draw the vectors on the diagram for $t = 1$ second:\n   - Draw a velocity vector $v$ tangential to the circle, 2 squares long since each square represents $2\\ m/s$.\n   - Draw a tangential acceleration vector $a_t$ opposite to the velocity vector, 1 square long (since each square represents $2\\ m/s^{2}$ and $a_t=-2\\ m/s^{2}$).\n   - Draw a centripetal acceleration vector $a_c$ pointing towards the centre of the circle, 2 squares long (since $a_c = 4\\ m/s^{2}$).\n5. Calculate the velocity of the coin at $t = 2$ seconds.\n   - At $t = 2$ seconds, $v = 6-2(2)=2\\ m/s$.\n6. Since the tangential acceleration ($a_t$) remains constant, it will be the same as at $t = 1$ second.\n   - So, $a_t=-2\\ m/s^{2}$ at $t = 2$ seconds.\n7. Calculate the centripetal acceleration ($a_c$) at $t = 2$ seconds.\n   - At $t = 2$ seconds, $v = 2\\ m/s$, so $a_c=2^{2}/4 = 1\\ m/s^{2}$.\n8. Draw the vectors on the diagram for $t = 2$ seconds:\n   - Draw a velocity vector $v$ tangential to the circle, 1 square long.\n   - Draw a tangential acceleration vector $a_t$ opposite to the velocity vector, 1 square long.\n   - Draw a centripetal acceleration vector $a_c$ pointing towards the centre of the circle, 0.5 square long (since $a_c = 1\\ m/s^{2}$ and each square represents $2\\ m/s^{2}$).\n\n**Step 2 - Explanation - Part B: Explanation for the difference in slipping speed between Trial 1 and Trial 2**\n1. Understand the conditions for slipping:\n   - The coin slips when it moves faster than $6\\ m/s$.\n2. Analyze Trial 1:\n   - The turntable starts at rest and increases speed very gradually. This likely allows friction to act over a longer period to prevent slipping until the speed exceeds $6\\ m/s$.\n3. Analyze Trial 2:\n   - The turntable's motion causes the coin's speed to increase at a rate of $8\\ m/s^{2}$, leading to a quicker build - up of speed, reaching $4\\ m/s$ before the coin slips.\n   - In Trial 1, the gradual increase in speed allows the static friction to adjust and hold the coin in place longer. In Trial 2, the rapid acceleration may overcome the static friction's maximum threshold sooner, causing the coin to slip at a lower speed.\n\n**Answer**\nPart A: At $t = 1\\ s$, velocity $v$ is $4\\ m/s$ tangential, tangential acceleration $a_t$ is $-2\\ m/s^{2}$ opposite to velocity, and centripetal acceleration $a_c$ is $4\\ m/s^{2}$ towards the center; at $t = 2\\ s$, $v$ is $2\\ m/s$ tangential, $a_t$ remains $-2\\ m/s^{2}$ opposite to velocity, and $a_c$ is $1\\ m/s^{2}$ towards the center.\nPart B: The coin slips at a lower speed in Trial 2 because the rapid acceleration of $8\\ m/s^{2}$ overcomes the static - friction threshold quicker than the gradual increase in Trial 1, causing slippage at just $4\\ m/s$ compared to exceeding $6\\ m/s$ in Trial 1."

Current in wire 1 ($I_1$): 2.54 A\n2. Current in wire 2 ($I_2$): 4.13 A\n3. Separation between the wires: 1.82 cm = 0.0182 m\n\n**Magnetic Field Expression**:\nThe magnetic field at a distance $r$ from a long straight wire carrying current $I$ is given by:\n$B=\\frac{\\mu_0I}{2\\pi r}$\nwhere:\n- $B$ is the magnetic field,\n- $\\mu_0 = 4\\pi\\times10^{-7}\\ T\\cdot m/A$ is the permeability of free space,\n- $r$ is the distance from the wire.\n\n**Explanation**:\nWe used the formula for the magnetic field produced by a long straight wire carrying current, which tells us how the strength of the magnetic field depends on the distance from the wire. The field decreases as you move farther from the wire.\n\n**Step 2**\n**Procedure**:\n1. Let the point where the magnetic fields cancel be at a distance $x$ to the right of wire 1.

    "answer": "**Solution**\n\n**Step 1**\n**Explanation**:\nThe energy that an object possesses as a result of motion is known as kinetic energy. Since it lacks direction and simply has magnitude, it is a scalar quantity.\nAn object's kinetic energy is determined by two factors:\n1. Its mass, or the amount of matter it contains.\n2. Its velocity, or the rate at which the thing moves.\nKinetic Energy Formula:\nThe following formula provides an object's kinetic energy ($K$):\n$K=\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$\nWhere:\n- $K$ is the object's kinetic energy, expressed in joules, or $J$.\n- $m$ is its mass, expressed in kilograms, or $kg$.\n- $v$ is its velocity, expressed in meters per second, or $\\frac{m}{s}$.\n**Important Points**:\n1. Directly proportional to mass: If the velocity remains constant, the kinetic energy rises as the object's mass does.\n2. Directly proportional to the square of velocity: Due to the square of the velocity ($v^{2}$), the kinetic energy rises more sharply as velocity increases.\n3. Units: The joule ($J$) is the unit of kinetic energy.\n - $1\\ J=1\\ kg\\cdot m^{2}/s^{2}$\n**Example**:\nFor a two - kilogram ($2\\ kg$) object traveling at $3\\frac{m}{s}$ (three meters per second)\n$K = \\frac{1}{2}\\times2\\times(3)^{2}=\\frac{1}{2}\\times2\\times9 = 9J$\n**Applications**:\nKinetic energy is crucial for comprehending how objects move, how forces function, and how energy changes in mechanical systems. The work - energy theorem, which asserts that the work done on an item is equal to the change in its kinetic energy, also requires its analysis.\nYour difficulty appears to be connected to classical physics, with a particular emphasis on the ideas of kinetic energy, work, and forces. Below is a summary of the pertinent subjects and topics that are involved:\n - The kinetic energy\n - A force by work done\n - Theorem of work energy\n - Kinetic - Energy from Velocity\n**Conceptual Links That Are Relevant**:\nFrictionless Surface: The problem states that there is no energy loss from friction because the surface is frictionless. As a result, all effort is directed toward altering the kinetic energy of the object.\nPosition versus Force Graph: This suggests that the force acting on the item is position - dependent and not constant. In these situations, the force's work is represented by the area beneath the graph.\nThis kind of issue frequently arises in beginning physics classes, especially when studying energy, mechanics, and the work - energy theorem.\n\n**Step 2**\nLet's tackle the issue one step at a time:\n**Section A: Determine the Kinetic Energy at $x = 3m$**\nWe are provided with:\n - Speed at $x = 3m$, $v=6.41\\frac{m}{s}$\n - The object's mass, $m = 28.6kg$\nThe following formula provides the kinetic energy:\n$K=\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$\nChanging the specified values:\n$K=\\frac{1}{2}\\times28.6kg\\times(6.41)^{2}\\frac{m^{2}}{s^{2}}$\n$K=\\frac{1}{2}\\times28.6\\times(6.41)^{2}$\n$K = 14.3\\times(41.0881)$\n$K = 587.56383J$\nThus, when $x = 3$, the kinetic energy\nThe approximate value of $K = 587.58J$\n**Section B: Determine the Work Performed by the Force between $x = 3m$ and $x = 10m$**\nThis section requires us to compute the force's work. The area under the force vs. position graph represents the work performed by a variable force. Since the query doesn't include the graph, I'll presume that if we know the force's at particular locations or if we have the data, we can calculate the work completed.\nI will be able to precisely calculate the job completed if you can supply the graph or specify about the force values. We are unable to move on with this step without this information.\nFor the time being, I'll presume that you can either supply that information or that we must draw conclusions from the data that is now accessible.\n\n**Step 3**\n**Section C: Determine the Kinetic Energy at $x = 10m$**\nThe work - energy theorem can be applied once the work completed in Part B (represented by $W$) has been calculated.\n$\\Delta K=W$\nThe difference between the kinetic energy at $x = 10m$ and the change in kinetic energy when $x = 3m$:\n$K_{10}-K_{3}=W$\n$K_{10}=K_{3}+W$\nWe already know from Part A that $K_{3}=587.8J$\nAfter determining $W$ (from Part B), we may compute $K_{10}$.\n**Section D: Determine the speed at $x = 10m$**\nTo determine the speed at $x = 10m$\nWe apply the kinetic energy to velocity formula for:\n$K_{10}=\\frac{1}{2}mv_{10}^{2}$\nPutting the equation in a different order to find $v_{10}$:\n$v_{10}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2K_{10}}{m}}$\nOnce $K_{10}$ has been determined from Part C, enter it and the mass $28.6kg$ into the formula to determine the velocity $v_{10}$.\n\n**Answer**\n**Summary of the Final Response**:\n - Kinetic energy at $x = 3$: $K = 587.8J$ (from Part A)\n - The force's work between $x = 3m$ and $x = 10m$: The force vs. location graph is required to determine.\n - Energy of motion at $x = 10m$: $K_{10}=K_{3}+W$, where $W$ is the work completed (as established by the graph).\n - Speed at $x = 10m$: $v_{10}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2K_{10}}{m}}$ where $K_{10}$ is computed following the determination of $W$."

    "answer": "Step 1\nStep 1: Conceptual Introduction\nThe circuit involved is a battery, resistor $R$ and inductor $L$. First, $S_1$ is closed and $S_2$ is open and hence a current flows constant in the circuit. If $S_1$ is opened and $S_2$ is closed, the battery is removed, so the resistor and inductor compose an RL - circuit. The resistor causes the instantaneous current to decay exponentially, while the inductor resists changes of current.\n\nKey concepts involved:\n1. RL Circuit Behavior: The energy stored in the inductor causes the current to decay exponentially when the battery is removed, as $I(t)=I_0e^{-t/\\tau}$. The time constant $\\tau = \\frac{L}{R}$.\n2. Initial current: When $t = 0$, the battery ceases to load, and the circuit current is then equal to the steady - state current which existed when the battery was coupled to the circuit.\n\nStep 2: Solution\nGiven Data:\n- $\\mathcal{E}=66.0\\ V$\n- $R = 240.0\\ \\Omega$\n- $L=0.140\\ H$\n- $t = 4.00\\times10^{-4}\\ s$\n\nPart A: [Instantaneous Value of Current at the start of the Process; i.e. Just after the $S_2$ is closed and $S_1$ is opened].\n1.

    "answer": "**Step 1 - Explanation**:\nTo find the first quartile (Q1) of a dataset, you need to determine the value below which 25% of the data falls. This is also known as the 25th percentile.\nHere are the steps to find the first quartile:\n1. Arrange the data in ascending order.\n2. Calculate the position of the first quartile using the formula: Position of Q1 = $\\frac{n + 1}{4}$ where n is the number of data points.\n3. If the position of Q1 is an integer, then Q1 is the data value at that position. If the position is not an integer, take the average of the data values at the two nearest positions.\n\n**Step 2 - Application to Dataset**:\nExplanation:\nSorting the given data points: 86,87,94,99,102,106,113,129,132,135,142,143,144,146,152,170\nCalculating the position of Q1:\nPosition of Q1 = $\\frac{17+ 1}{4}=\\frac{18}{4}=4.5$\nSince the position is not an integer, we take the average of the data values at positions 4 and 5: Q1 = $\\frac{99 + 102}{2}=\\frac{201}{2}=100.5$\nSimilarly,\nCalculating the position of Q3:\nPosition of Q3 = $3\\times\\frac{17 + 1}{4}=3\\times\\frac{18}{4}=\\frac{54}{4}=13.5$\nSince the position is not an integer, we take the average of the data values at positions 13 and 14: Q3 = $\\frac{143+144}{2}=\\frac{287}{2}=143.5$\nSo, the third quartile of the poultry hot - dog calorie counts is Q3 = 143.5\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: Q3 = 143.5\n\n**Answer**:\nSo, first quartile Q1 = 100.5\nand third quartile Q3 = 143.5"

    "answer": "**Step 1**\nLet $t$ be the time of accelerated motion.\nExplanation: Distance $S_a$ traveled during accelerated motion is determined from equation of motion $S_a = ut+\\frac{1}{2}at^{2}$. Since $u = 0$ (initial - speed because elevator starts from rest) and $a$ is acceleration.\nDistance $S_a$ traveled during accelerated motion is $S_a=\\frac{1}{2}at^{2}=\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\times5\\times t^{2}=2.5t^{2}$\nExplanation: Speed $v$ of elevator after traveling distance $S_a$ is determined from equation of motion $v = u+at$.\nSpeed $v$ of elevator after traveling distance $S_a$: $v=a\\times t = 5\\times t\\cdots(1)$\nExplanation: If the elevator is decelerated in order to stop at top - floor, distance $S_r$ moved during decelerated time is determined from equation of motion $v_f^{2}=v^{2}-(2a_rS_r)$. Where $v_f = 0$ (final speed because elevator come to rest at top - floor) and $a_r$ is deceleration.\nDistance $S_r$ moved during decelerated time is $S_r=\\frac{v^{2}}{2a_r}\\cdots(2)$\nThen by substituting $v$ from eqn.(1) and $a_r = 2\\mathrm{ft/s}^2$ we get $S_r = 6.25t^{2}$\nIf total distance is $40\\mathrm{ft}$, then we have $S_a + S_r=(2.5 + 6.25)t^{2}=40\\mathrm{ft}$\nHence from above expression we get $t = 2.14\\mathrm{s}$\n\n**Step 2**\nExplanation: time - duration $t_r$ of decelerated motion is determined from equation of motion $v_f=v-(a_rt_r)$\ntime - duration $t_r$ of decelerated motion is $t_r=\\frac{v}{a_r}=\\frac{5\\times t}{2}=2.5t=2.5\\times2.14\\mathrm{s}=5.35\\mathrm{s}$\nTotal travel time $T$ is $T=t + t_r=(2.14 + 5.35)\\mathrm{s}\\approx7.5\\mathrm{s}$\nExplanation: Above time $T$ is shortest time because the entire motion of elevator consists of accelerated and decelerated motion.

    "answer": "**Step 1**\nFor this problem, we must consider the forces acting on the box at the point of interest B. We see that the object was dropped in such a way that it slid on the surface, so the only force that makes the body accelerate downwards is gravity. On the other hand, since the box slides on the surface, it exerts a force on the surface which is returned by Newton's third - law. We can perform a sum of forces to determine the value of the forces in question:\n$\\sum F = ma$\nAdditionally, the exercise gives us a straight - line equation $y = x$ that intersects the surface at point B. From there we can find the coordinates of the point and verify that the line is normal to the surface at that point.\n**Explanation**:\nTo determine where the line intersects the surface, it is enough to substitute $y = x$ into the surface equation.\n\n**Step 2**\nFirst, let's see what the coordinates of point B are:\nWe have the surface equation $x^{\\frac{1}{2}}+y^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 3$ and $y = x$.\nSubstitute $y = x$ into the surface equation:\n$$ \\begin{align*} x^{\\frac{1}{2}}+x^{\\frac{1}{2}}&=3\\\\ 2x^{\\frac{1}{2}}&=3\\\\ x^{\\frac{1}{2}}&=\\frac{3}{2}\\\\ x&=\\frac{9}{4} \\end{align*} $$\nNow, let's determine the slope of the line normal to the surface at $x=\\frac{9}{4}$.\nStarting from $x^{\\frac{1}{2}}+y^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 3$, we can rewrite it as $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}=3 - x^{\\frac{1}{2}}$, then $y=(3 - x^{\\frac{1}{2}})^2=9 - 6x^{\\frac{1}{2}}+x$.\nDifferentiating $y$ with respect to $x$: $y^\\prime=- 3x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}+1$.\nEvaluating the derivative at $x = \\frac{9}{4}$:\n$$ \\begin{align*} y^\\prime\\left(x=\\frac{9}{4}\\right)&=-3\\left(\\frac{9}{4}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}+1\\\\ y^\\prime\\left(\\frac{9}{4}\\right)&=-1 \\end{align*} $$\nThe slope of the normal line is $\\frac{-1}{y^\\prime\\left(\\frac{9}{4}\\right)} = 1$.\nSo the line $y = x$ with slope $1$ is normal to the surface at B.\n**Explanation**:\nWe remember that the negative reciprocal of the slope of this line must be equal to the derivative of the surface equation evaluated at the point.\n\n**Step 3**\nNow, let's review the forces on the box just at point B. If we consider a reference system where the $x^\\prime$ - axis is tangent to the surface at B and the $y^\\prime$ - axis is normal to the surface at B, we can draw the following force diagram:\n[Here is a description of a force - diagram with a normal force $\\mathbf{F_N}$, a weight force $mg$ and an angle $\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ between the weight vector and the normal - to - surface axis]\nWhere $\\mathbf{F_N}$ is the normal force and $mg$ is the weight force.\n**Explanation**:\nNote that the angle is $45^{\\circ}$ because of the slope of the line normal to the surface at B that we found in the previous step. $\\theta=\\arctan(1)$\n\n**Step 4**\nFinally, let's see that the box does not move in the $y^\\prime$ - direction, so the acceleration in this axis is zero. According to Newton's second law, the sum of forces in this axis must also be zero. So:\n$$ \\begin{align*} \\sum F_{y^\\prime}&=0\\\\ \\sum F_{y^\\prime}&=F_N - mg\\cos\\theta\\\\ \\sum F_{y^\\prime}&=F_N-(5\\text{kg})\\left(9.8\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}^2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\\\ 0&=F_N-(34.65\\text{N})\\\\ F_N&=34.65\\text{N} \\end{align*} $$\n**Explanation**:\nWe see that this normal force found is the one that the surface exerts on the box in the positive $y^\\prime$ direction, and the exercise asks for the force that the box exerts on the surface. But the force that the box exerts on the surface has the same magnitude but in the opposite direction to the previously found $F_N$ (by Newton's third law).\n\n**Answer**\nThe magnitude of the normal force that the box exerts on the surface is $34.65\\text{N}$\n![](images/149614370_2e3ee97f2b441c8937b9bb9dae9e02b1b2dd59d1a85c045737e950d7fda7105a.jpg)"

    "answer": "**Step 1**\nExplanation:\nTo solve this problem, we can use Gauss's Law, which states that the electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the enclosed charge divided by the permittivity of free - space ($\\varepsilon_0$).\nFor a spherical shell with uniform charge distribution, the electric field outside the shell behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere. Therefore, the electric field at a distance r from the center of the shell is given by:\n$E = \\frac{k\\cdot Q}{r^{2}}$\nWhere:\n- E is the electric field magnitude at distance r,\n- k is Coulomb's constant ($8.9875\\times10^{9}\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C^{2}}$),\n- Q is the total charge enclosed within the spherical shell, and\n- r is the distance from the center of the shell.\n\n**Step 2**\nExplanation:\nGiven that $E = 4.8\\times10^{6}\\frac{N}{C}$ and $r = 0.60m$, we can use the formula to solve for Q:\n$Q=\\frac{E\\cdot r^{2}}{k}$\n$Q=\\frac{(4.8\\times 10^{6}\\frac{N}{C})\\cdot(0.60m)^{2}}{8.9875\\times 10^{9}\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C^{2}}}$\n$Q\\approx\\frac{1.728\\times 10^{-3}C}{8.9875\\times 10^{9}}$\n$Q\\approx192\\mu C$\nSo, the value of Q is approximately $192\\mu C$.\n\n**Answer**\nAmong the given options, none matches exactly with $192\\mu C$.

    "question": "Hummingbirds may seem fragile, but their wings are capable of sustaining very large forces and accelerations. (Figure 1) shows data for the vertical position of the wing tip of a rufous hummingbird. What is the maximum acceleration of the wing tips, in m/s²? What is the maximum acceleration of the wing tips, in units of g? Please answer with explanations in each step... I am very confused. Thank you!!\nThe graph shows a sinusoidal - like variation of the vertical position $y$ (in mm) of the wing - tip with time $t$ (in ms).\n### Step 1: Determine the equation of motion\nThe general equation for simple harmonic motion is $y = A\\sin(\\omega t+\\varphi)$, where $A$ is the amplitude, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, $t$ is time, and $\\varphi$ is the phase constant. From the graph, the amplitude $A = 40\\space mm=0.04\\space m$. The period $T$ of the motion can be determined from the graph. The time between two consecutive peaks is $T = 40\\space ms = 0.04\\space s$.\nThe angular frequency $\\omega$ is related to the period by the formula $\\omega=\\frac{2\\pi}{T}$. Substituting $T = 0.04\\space s$ into the formula, we get $\\omega=\\frac{2\\pi}{0.04}= 50\\pi\\space rad/s$.\n### Step 2: Find the velocity and acceleration equations\nThe velocity $v$ of an object in simple - harmonic motion is the first - derivative of the position function with respect to time. Given $y = A\\sin(\\omega t+\\varphi)$, then $v=\\frac{dy}{dt}=A\\omega\\cos(\\omega t+\\varphi)$.\nThe acceleration $a$ is the second - derivative of the position function with respect to time. Differentiating the velocity function, we get $a=\\frac{dv}{dt}=-A\\omega^{2}\\sin(\\omega t+\\varphi)$.\nThe maximum value of the acceleration occurs when $\\vert\\sin(\\omega t+\\varphi)\\vert = 1$. So, the maximum acceleration $a_{max}=A\\omega^{2}$.\n### Step 3: Calculate the maximum acceleration in m/s²\nSubstitute $A = 0.04\\space m$ and $\\omega = 50\\pi\\space rad/s$ into the formula for $a_{max}$:\n$$ \\begin{align*} a_{max}&=A\\omega^{2}\\\\ &=0.04\\times(50\\pi)^{2}\\\\ &=0.04\\times2500\\pi^{2}\\\\ & = 100\\pi^{2}\\space m/s^{2}\\\\ &\\approx 100\\times9.87\\\\ &=987\\space m/s^{2} \\end{align*} $$\n### Step 4: Calculate the maximum acceleration in units of $g$\nWe know that $g = 9.8\\space m/s^{2}$. To express the acceleration in units of $g$, we divide $a_{max}$ by $g$:\n$$ n=\\frac{a_{max}}{g}=\\frac{100\\pi^{2}}{9.8}\\approx\\frac{987}{9.8}\\approx100.7 $$\nSo, the maximum acceleration of the wing - tips in m/s² is $100\\pi^{2}\\approx987\\space m/s^{2}$, and in units of $g$ is approximately $100.7g$.\n<image>",

    "answer": "**Step 1**\n4)\n(i) For $r > R$\nConsider a gaussian sphere of radius $r$ around the sphere.\nFrom the above - Figure, the dotted sphere represents the gaussian surface, where $d\\vec{A}$ is the area vector.\nThe total charge enclosed within the gaussian sphere is $q_{enc}=+e - e=0$\nFrom gauss law:\n$\\oint\\vec{E}\\cdot d\\vec{A}=\\frac{q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_0}$\n$E\\oint dA=\\frac{q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_0}$\n$EA = \\frac{q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_0}$\n$E=\\frac{q_{enc}}{A\\epsilon_0}$ -----(1)\nBy substituting the values we get $E = 0$. So the electric field at $r > R$ is zero.\n(ii) For $r = R$\nNow for $r = R$, that's on the surface also, the charge enclosed will be zero. So here also, the electric field will be zero.\n(iii) For $r < R$\nConsider a gaussian sphere of radius $r$ inside the sphere.\nLet $q'$ be the charge on the inner gaussian surface of radius $r$.\nWe know that volume charge density is constant throughout the sphere which is $\\rho=\\frac{-e}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^{3}}$.\nIf $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^{3}$ volume contains $-e$ charge, then let $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}$ volume contains $q'$ charge.\nSo we can write,\n$\\frac{q'}{-e}=\\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^{3}}$\n$q'=-e(\\frac{r^{3}}{R^{3}})$\nNow the Total charge inside the inner gaussian surface can be written as $q_{enc}=e + q'=e - e(\\frac{r^{3}}{R^{3}})=e(1 - \\frac{r^{3}}{R^{3}})$\nSo Applying gauss law.\nThe area of the inner gaussian sphere is $A = 4\\pi r^{2}$\nSubstitute all these in eq - 1.\n$E_{r < R}=\\frac{e(1-\\frac{r^{3}}{R^{3}})}{4\\pi r^{2}\\epsilon_0}$\n$E_{r < R}=\\frac{e}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r^{2}}(1 - \\frac{r^{3}}{R^{3}})$\nIf we substitute $r = R$, we get Electric field as zero on the surface.

The equation Using:\n$v_{y}=g\\cdot t$\nSubstituting $g = 9.8$ m/s² and $t\\approx3.03$ s:\n$v_{y}=9.8\\cdot3.03\\approx29.7$ m/s\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total velocity ($v$)\nThe total velocity is related to the vector elements of the horizontal velocity $v_{x}$ and the vertical velocity $v_{y}$ Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n$V=\\sqrt{v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}}$\nSubstituting $v_{x}=5$ m/s and $v_{y}\\approx29.7$ m/s:\n$V=\\sqrt{5^{2}+29.7^{2}}=\\sqrt{25 + 882.09}$\n$=\\sqrt{907.09}\\approx30.12$ m/s\n\nExplanation:\nThe initial horizontal velocity remains the same throughout the duration ($v_{x}=5$ m/s), so the vertical velocity increases due to the acceleration due to gravity ($v_{y}$). It deflected at almost the same speed as when it was released from free fall.\n\nAnswer\n(a) Horizontal distance: $\\Delta x\\approx15.15$ m\n(b) Velocity at impact: $v\\approx30.12$ m/s"

    "difficulty": 5,
    "answer": "### Solution\n\n#### Step 1\n**Given Information**\n- Mass of the disk: $m = 1.0\\ kg$\n- Radius of the disk: $r = 2.0\\ m$\n- Forces acting on the disk:\n  - $F_1=40.0\\ N$ at an angle of $30^{\\circ}$ from the horizontal\n  - $F_2 = 5.0\\ N$ acting vertically downward\n- Moment of inertia of the disk about its center (for a solid disk):\n$I=\\frac{1}{2}mr^{2}=\\frac{1}{2}(1.0)(2.0)^{2}=2.0\\ kg\\cdot m^{2}$\n\n**Explanation**:\nWe identified the important details: the disk's mass, radius, and the forces acting on it. We also noted the direction and magnitude of the forces and determined the disk's resistance to rotation using its moment of inertia.\n\n#### Step 2\n**2. Torque Calculation**\nThe torque ($\\tau$) is given by:\n$\\tau = rF_{\\text{perpendicular}}$\nFor each force, we calculate the perpendicular component of the force to the radius of the disk.\n(a) **Torque due to $F_1$**: The perpendicular component of $F_1$ is:\n$F_{1\\perp}=F_1\\sin(30^{\\circ}) = 40.0\\times0.5 = 20.0\\ N$\nThe torque due to $F_1$ is:\n$\\tau_1=rF_{1\\perp}=2.0\\times20.0 = 40.0\\ N\\cdot m$\n(b) **Torque due to $F_2$**: The force $F_2$ is already perpendicular to the radius of the disk. Its torque is:\n$\\tau_2 = rF_2=2.0\\times5.0 = 10.0\\ N\\cdot m$\n(c) **Net Torque**: The direction of the torques matters. Let clockwise torques be positive and counter - clockwise torques be negative. $F_1$ creates a counter - clockwise torque, while $F_2$ creates a clockwise torque.\nThus, the net torque is:\n$\\tau_{\\text{net}}=-\\tau_1+\\tau_2=- 40.0 + 10.0=-30.0\\ N\\cdot m$\n\n**Explanation**:\nWe calculated the twisting effect (torque) caused by each force. For $F_1$, we found its perpendicular component using the angle provided. $F_2$ was already perpendicular, so we directly calculated its torque. Finally, we combined the torques, considering their directions (clockwise or counter - clockwise).\n\n#### Step 3\n**3. Angular Acceleration**\nThe angular acceleration ($\\alpha$) is related to the net torque and moment of inertia by:\n$\\alpha=\\frac{\\tau_{\\text{net}}}{I}$\nSubstitute the values:\n$\\alpha=\\frac{-30.0}{2.0}=-15.0\\ rad/s^{2}$\n\n**Explanation**:\nWe used the net torque (total twisting force) and the disk's resistance to rotation (moment of inertia) to find how fast the disk spins faster or slower - its angular acceleration.\n\n### Answer\nThe angular acceleration of the disk is: $-15\\ rad/s^{2}$"

The piston is subject to both gravitational force and spring force, which oppose its motion as it is raised. We are also tasked with determining the initial and final pressures in the cylinder, assuming atmospheric pressure is 100 kPa.\n\n**Key points in the problem**:\n- The piston has a mass of 8 kg and a cross - sectional area of 0.002 m².\n- The piston is raised by a distance of 0.15 meters.\n- The spring has a spring constant of 4,000 N/m.\n- The surrounding atmospheric pressure is 100 kPa.\n- The gas in the cylinder does the work to lift the piston against gravity and the spring's force.\n\n**Our goal is to**:\n1. Calculate the total work done to lift the piston.\n2. Find the initial and final gauge pressures inside the cylinder.\n\nWe will break this problem into manageable steps, first calculating the work done against gravity, then calculating the work done against the spring, and lastly calculating the work required for the gas expansion.\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe problem involves calculating the total work required to lift a piston and determining the pressure changes during expansion.\n\n#### Step 2\n** Work Done Against Gravitational Force**\n\nTo calculate the work done to lift the piston, we first need to determine the force due to gravity acting on the piston. The gravitational force is calculated using:\n$$ F_{gravity}=m\\cdot g $$\nWhere:\n- $m = 8\\mathrm{kg}$ (mass of the piston),\n- $g = 9.8\\mathrm{m/s^2}$ (acceleration due to gravity).\n\nSo, the force due to gravity is:\n$$ F_{gravity}=8\\mathrm{kg}\\cdot9.8\\mathrm{m/s^2}=78.4\\mathrm{N} $$\n\nThe work done against gravity is calculated using the formula:\n$$ W_{gravity}=F_{gravity}\\cdot d $$\nWhere:\n- $d = 0.15\\mathrm{m}$ is the distance the piston moves.\n\nNow, substituting the values:\n$$ W_{gravity}=78.4\\mathrm{N}\\cdot0.15\\mathrm{m}=11.76\\mathrm{J} $$\n\nThus, the work done against gravity is 11.76 J.\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe gravitational force opposes the upward movement of the piston, and the work done against this force is calculated by multiplying the force with the displacement. The force results from the piston's weight in the gravitational field.\n\n#### Step 3\n** Work Done Against Spring Force**\n\nThe work done to compress or stretch the spring is determined by Hooke's Law. The force exerted by the spring is given by:\n$$ F_{spring}=k\\cdot x $$\nWhere:\n- $k = 4000\\mathrm{N/m}$ is the spring constant,\n- $x = 0.15\\mathrm{m}$ is the displacement of the piston.\n\nThe work done against the spring is given by the formula:\n$$ W_{spring}=\\frac{1}{2}kx^{2} $$\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$ W_{spring}=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot4000\\mathrm{N/m}\\cdot(0.15\\mathrm{m})^{2} $$\n$$ W_{spring}=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot4000\\cdot0.0225 = 45\\mathrm{J} $$\n\nThus, the work done against the spring is 45 J.\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe spring opposes the piston's upward motion. The work done against the spring is calculated using the spring constant and displacement, considering the spring's resistance to change.\n\n#### Answer\n** Final Answer**\n- Total work required: $56.76\\mathrm{J}$ (since $W_{total}=W_{gravity}+W_{spring}=11.76 + 45=56.76\\mathrm{J}$)\n- Initial pressure: 100 kPa (atmospheric pressure)\n- Final pressure: Requires further thermodynamic calculations, but would be higher than 100 kPa due to the gas expansion."

    "difficulty": 2,
    "answer": "**Solution**\n\n**Step 1**\n**Given Data**\n- Wavelength of light, $\\lambda = 515nm=515\\times 10^{-9}m$\n- Slit width, $b = 90\\mu m = 90\\times 10^{- 6}m$\n- Distance from slit to screen, $L = 2m$\n- Polarizer 1 occupies $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the slit width with a vertical transmission axis.\n- Polarizer 2 occupies $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the slit width with a transmission axis normal to the page.\n- Incoming light is polarized at $45^{\\circ}$ to each polarizer.\n\nThe problem is related to diffraction and polarization of light. In single - slit diffraction the light waves get spread out and come out from the other side with a diffraction pattern on the screen as bright and dark fringes. The condition for zero irradiance (dark fringes) is governed by the single - slit diffraction equation:\n$b\\sin\\theta=m\\lambda$,\n$m = 1,2,3,\\cdots$\n\n**Explanation**:\nHere $b$ is the slit width, $\\lambda$ is the wavelength, and $m$ is the order of the dark fringe. For small angles, $\\sin\\theta\\approx\\tan\\theta = y/L$, where $y$ is the fringe position and $L$ is the distance to the screen.\nThe measurements done on the irradiance of the polarizers are described by Malus's Law. The intensity of the transmitted polarized light through the polarizer is given by $\\cos^{2}\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the light's polarization direction and the polarizer's transmission axis. Here, the incoming light is polarized at $45^{\\circ}$ to both polarizers, leading to a $50\\%$ reduction in transmitted intensity for each segment.\n\n**Formulas**\n**Single - slit diffraction minimum**\n$\\sin\\theta=\\frac{m\\lambda}{b}$, $m = 1$ (for the first minimum)\n$y = L\\sin\\theta$\n\n**Intensity with polarizers**\n$I_{with\\ polarizers}=\\frac{1}{3}\\times0.5+\\frac{2}{3}\\times0.5$\n$=0.5\\times(\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{2}{3})$\n$=0.5$\n\n**Intensity increase factor**\n$Factor\\ of\\ increase=\\frac{I_{without\\ polarizers}}{I_{with\\ polarizers}}$\n\n**Step 2**\n**Calculations**\n**a) First Zero Irradiance Position**\nUsing the diffraction minimum condition\n$\\sin\\theta=\\frac{\\lambda}{b}$\n$=\\frac{515\\times 10^{-9}}{90\\times 10^{-6}}$\n$=0.00572$\nFor small angles, $\\sin\\theta\\approx\\tan\\theta=\\frac{y}{L}$\n$y = L\\sin\\theta$\n$=2\\times0.00572$\n$=0.01144m$\n$=1.144cm$\n\n**b) Factor of Increase in Irradiance**\n**With polarizers**\n$I_{with\\ polarizers}=\\frac{1}{3}\\times0.5+\\frac{2}{3}\\times0.5$\n$=0.5$\n\n**Without polarizers**\n$I_{without\\ polarizers}=1$\n\n**Increase factor**\n$Factor\\ of\\ increase=\\frac{1}{0.5}$\n$=2$\n\n**Conclusion**\n- a. Diffraction pattern first reaches zero irradiance at a distance of: $1.144cm$ from the optical axis.\n- b. The irradiance of the central maximum increases by a factor of: $2$\n\nThe diffraction pattern is developed owing to the fact that the light waves passing through the slit interfere with each other. The positions of the dark fringes both depend on the design of the experiment as well as the specific wavelength of the light source used. The silicon layer and the first polarizer cause an addition of further intensity reduction because the light is only partially transmitted as the result of its polarization with the plane perpendicular to the polarizers' axes.\nWhen the polarizers are removed, all the light which is cast through the slit passes in to the central maximum whose intensity is therefore doubled.\n\n**Explanation**:\nThis show how polarization can be employed to regulate the brightness of light, the application being in polarizing filters and many optical systems.\n\n**Answer**\n**Final Answers**\n- a) The diffraction pattern first reaches zero irradiance at $1.144cm$.\n- b) The irradiance of the central maximum increases by a factor of $2$"

Then the first stage detaches and the second - stage fires, providing a constant acceleration of $a_2 = 38\\frac{m}{s^2}$ for the time interval $t_2 = 71s$.\n**Part (a)**\nWe use the kinematic equation $v = v_0+at$. Since the rocket starts from rest ($v_0 = 0$), the speed $v_1$ of the rocket at time $t_1$ is given by the equation $v_1=a_1t_1$.\n**Part (b)**\nThe speed of the rocket at the end of the first - stage is $v_1=a_1t_1$. This speed becomes the initial speed for the second - stage of acceleration.\nUsing the kinematic equation $v = v_0+at$ again, where $v_0 = a_1t_1$ and $a = a_2$ and $t=t_2$, the speed $v_2$ at the end of the second - stage of acceleration is $v_2=a_1t_1 + a_2t_2$.\n**Part (c)**\n1. First, find the distance traveled in the first stage:\n   - We use the kinematic equation $x_1=v_0t_1+\\frac{1}{2}a_1t_1^2$. Since $v_0 = 0$, $x_1=\\frac{1}{2}a_1t_1^2$.\n2. Then, find the distance traveled in the second stage:\n   - We use the kinematic equation $x_2=v_1t_2+\\frac{1}{2}a_2t_2^2$, and since $v_1=a_1t_1$, we have $x_2=a_1t_1t_2+\\frac{1}{2}a_2t_2^2$.\n3. The total distance $x$ traveled by the rocket from launch until the end of the second - stage of acceleration is:\n   - $x=x_1 + x_2=\\frac{1}{2}a_1t_1^2+a_1t_1t_2+\\frac{1}{2}a_2t_2^2$.\nSo:\n- Part (a): $v_1=a_1t_1$\n- Part (b): $v_2=a_1t_1 + a_2t_2$\n- Part (c): $x=\\frac{1}{2}a_1t_1^2+a_1t_1t_2+\\frac{1}{2}a_2t_2^2$\n<image>",

    "answer": "Step - by - Step Solution:\n\nStep 1: If you understand the Circuit Configuration\n1. There are two switches $S_1$ and $S_2$, an inductor $L = 1\\ H$, two voltage sources $\\varepsilon=10\\ V$\n2. Immediately after, switch $S_1$ is closed while $S_2$ is open for a long time. The current through the inductor reaches a steady - state it becomes constant.\n3. The substitution is performed while $S_2$ is being treated as closed, so that a loop, added with more components (a resistor $2R$ and a voltage source $30\\ V$) is formed.\n\nStep 2: Prior to closing $S_2$ Steady - state Current\n - Since, switch $S_1$ is closed for quite sometime, the current through the inductor reaches constant value.\n - Since the inductor is shorted in the steady - state, that is to say, it doesn't present any resistance to the DC current.\n - The voltage $\\varepsilon = 10\\ V$ is the only factor on the voltage source that determines the amount of current $I$ flowing in the inductor.\n - Ohm's Law for the initial current: $I_{initial}=\\frac{\\varepsilon}{R}=\\frac{10}{R}$ (steady - state current)\n\nStep 3: Behavior of Inductor When Switch $S_2$ is Closed\nExplanation:\nHere, in case switch $S_2$ is closed the inductor is going to oppose any sudden change in the current through it due to self - inductance.\n - According to the properties of inductors:\n    - Just after closing the switch the inductor momentarily holds the same current($I_{initial}=\\frac{10}{R}$).\n    - A new configuration of the circuit changes the rate of current change $\\frac{dI}{dt}$.\n\nStep 4: Write Kirchhoff's Voltage Law for the New Loop.\nAfter $S_2$ is closed, the inductor $L$ is part of the following loop:\n - Loop that I recall myself is this path: $B\\rightarrow C\\rightarrow D\\rightarrow E\\rightarrow B$.\n - Components in the loop:\n    - A voltage source $10\\ V$ (from the left branch).\n    - Voltage number $30\\ V$ in the right branch.\n    - There are: Resistors $R$ and $2R$.\n    - An inductor $L$ (an element which opposes any change in current).\nApply Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL):\n - Sum of voltage drops around the loop: $\\varepsilon - L\\frac{dI}{dt}-IR - 2RI=3\\varepsilon$\nSubstituting the values:\n - $\\varepsilon = 10\\ V$,\n - Inductance $L = 1\\ H$,\n - $3\\varepsilon=30\\ V$:\n    - $10 - L\\frac{dI}{dt}-IR - 2RI = 30$\nSimplify:\n - $L\\frac{dI}{dt}=40 - 3RI$\n\nStep 5: Substitute Initial Current into the Equation\n - Just after $S_2$ is closed, the current through the inductor is still the initial steady - state value.\n - $I=\\frac{10}{R}$\n - Substitute $I = \\frac{10}{R}$ into the KVL equation:\n    - $L\\frac{dI}{dt}=40 - 3R(\\frac{10}{R})$\n    - Simplify the terms:\n    - $L\\frac{dI}{dt}=40 - 30=10\\ A/s$\n\nStep 6: Conclusion\nThe magnitude of the rate of change of current in the inductor immediately after switch $S_2$ is closed is:\n - $10\\ A/s$\nExplanation:\nThis value specifies at what rate the current in the inductor change, right after the switch has been closed. As inductors oppose abrupt changes to the current, the rate of change of current expresses the contribution of the new voltage source and resistance to the circuit.\n\nAnswer\nExplanation:\nIf we close switch $S_1$ and open switch $S_2$, delaying this for a long time, the circuit comes to steady state and the inductor acts as a short circuit (zero resistance to DC current). The initial current through the inductor is determined by Ohm's law:\n - $I_{initial}=\\frac{\\varepsilon}{R}=\\frac{10}{R}$\nKey Concept:\nInductors do not appreciate sudden current changes. When switch $S_2$ is closed the configuration of the circuit is currently different than when we found the last time, and we must find the rate of change of current $\\frac{dI}{dt}$ through the inductor.\nApply Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL):\nIn the loop $B\\rightarrow C\\rightarrow D\\rightarrow E\\rightarrow B$, applying KVL:\n - $10 - L\\frac{dI}{dt}-IR - 2RI = 30$\nSubstituting $L = 1\\ H,\\varepsilon = 10\\ V$, and $I=\\frac{10}{R}$ (initial steady - state current):\n - $L\\frac{dI}{dt}=40 - 3R(\\frac{10}{R})=40 - 30 = 10\\ A/s$\nConclusion:\nThe magnitude of the rate of change of current in the inductor just after the switch $S_2$ is closed is:\n - $10\\ A/s$\nThis result demonstrates that the inductor resists change in current, but the current in the new circuit configuration changes at a rate of $10\\ A/s$. This rapid change is due to the combined effects of the addition of the voltage source of $30\\ V$ and of the resistances $R$ and $2R$."

Shortest time from House A to House B ($\\Delta t_{AB}$)\nKey Concept:\nThe shortest time corresponds to driving the boat directly toward House B without compensating for the river's current.

Shortest time from House A to House C ($\\Delta t_{AC}$)\nKey Concept:\nThe shortest time to cross from House A to House C occurs when the boat's velocity relative to the river is directed straight toward House C. The resultant velocity of the boat must counteract the river's current. This requires using vector components to find the effective velocity and time.\n1. Decompose the boat's velocity:\n   - The river's current is along $+y$ with $V_{R,H}=2.4\\ m/s$.\n   - The boat's $y - component$ must cancel $V_{R,H}$, so:\n$V_{B,y}=V_{R,H}=2.4\\ m/s$\n2.

    "answer": "**Step 1**\nQ1. Current will flow in resistance $R_1$ from B to P because B is at higher potential and P is at lower potential. So correct choice is (A)\nQ2. (A) No, because current intensity through both points is same because current supply by battery at point A is equal to current receive by battery at point M. So option A is incorrect.\n(B) is incorrect, current at point I is $\\frac{V_G - V_I}{R_4+R_5}=\\frac{8 - 0}{2 + 6}=\\frac{8}{8}=1A$, current at point J = current at point I = 1A. Current at point K = 1 + 1 = 2A\n**Explanation**: Since current through $R_3=\\frac{V_B - V_J}{R_3}=\\frac{8 - 0}{8}=1A$, that means current through K = 1A+1A = 2A, similarly current through L is 3A, and current through M is 4A.\n(C) Incorrect because current through F is equal to current through G,H,I\n(D) Correct, yes these are at zero potential\n(E) No, its incorrect, there is 1A at I and J, 2A at K, 3A at L, and 4A at point M.\n**Step 2**\nQ3.

    "answer": "**Step 1**\nFirst calculate the modulus of rigidity of the bolt material from the stress - strain diagram. Use relation between modulus of rigidity, Poisson's ratio and modulus of elasticity to calculate modulus of elasticity of the material. Use definition of shear stress to calculate required force P.\n- **Hook’s Law**: Hook's law establishes the relation between the stress and strain for a particular material, relation results in a ratio for each stress and strain combination of the material. These constant values are known as elastic constant.\n- **Yield stress**: Yield stress is the value of the stress at which the material is at the verge to go in the plastic region of the material deformation.\n- The expression of modulus of rigidity of material by Hook's law is expressed as, $G=\\frac{\\tau}{\\gamma}$\n  - here, $\\tau$ is the shear stress and $\\gamma$ is the shear strain.\n- The relation between modulus of rigidity, Poisson's ratio and modulus of elasticity is as below, $E = 2G(1+\\mu)$\n  - Here, $E$ is the modulus of elasticity, $G$ is the modulus of rigidity and $\\mu$ is Poisson's ratio.\n- The expression for shear stress is as below, $\\tau=\\frac{P}{A}$\n  - Here, $P$ is applied shear force and $A$ is the area of cross - section.\n- Now, write the expression for the modulus of the rigidity of the bolt. $G=\\frac{\\tau_y}{\\gamma}$\n  - Here, $\\tau_y$ is yield shear stress and the $\\gamma$ is shear strain in the bolt at the $\\tau_y$ stress.\n  - Substitute $50$ ksi for $\\tau_y$ and $0.004$ for $\\gamma$, $G=\\frac{50\\ ksi}{0.004}=12,500$ ksi\n- Write the expression for modulus of elasticity of the bolt. $E = 2G(1+\\nu)$\n  - Here, $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio.\n  - Substitute $12,500$ ksi for $G$ and $0.3$ for $\\nu$. $E = 2(12,500\\ ksi)(1 + 0.3)=32,500$ ksi\n\n**Explanation**: The value of the shear stress and corresponding shear strain has been obtained from the stress - strain curve of the bolt material. The expression for the shear modulus provided by the Hook's law has been used to calculate the value of the shear modulus of the bolt material. The relation between the shear modulus and the modulus of the elasticity has been used to calculate the value of the modulus of the elasticity.\n\n**Step 2**\n- Write the expression for area of cross - section of the bolt. $A=\\frac{\\pi}{4}d^{2}$\n  - Here, $A$ is area of the cross - section of the bolt.\n  - Substitute $0.25$ in for $d$. $A=\\frac{\\pi}{4}(0.25\\ in)^{2}=0.049\\ in^{2}$\n- Write the expression for the yield shear stress in the terms of the force $P$. $\\tau_y=\\frac{P}{A}$\n  - Substitute $50$ ksi for $\\tau_y$, $0.049\\ in^{2}$ for $A$. $P=(50\\ ksi)(0.049\\ in^{2}) = 2.454$ kip\n\n**Explanation**: Cross - section area of the bolt is calculated as the diameter of the bolt has been provided.

    "answer": "**Step 1**\n(1) Gauss's law can be used to determine the electric field between the two spheres. Between the two spheres, we select a Gaussian surface that is a spherical shell with radius $r$. We can take the electric field outside of the integral because it is radial and has the same magnitude throughout the Gaussian surface and the enclosed charge is $Q$.\nSo, using Gauss's law:\n$\\int E.dA=\\frac{Q}{\\epsilon_{0}}$\nExplanation:\nWhere, the integral is over the Gaussian shell's surface - area and $\\epsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of free space.\nSince the spherical shell's surface area is $4\\pi r^{2}$, so:\n$E(r).4\\pi r^{2}=\\frac{Q}{\\epsilon_{0}}$\n$E(r)=\\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}r^{2}}$\nHere, $E(r)$ is the electric - field strength between the two spheres as a function of $r$, the distance from the sphere centres.\n\n**Step 2**\n(2) We must integrate the electric field from the negative electrode (at $R_{1}$) to the positive electrode (at $R_{2}$) in order to determine the potential difference between the two spheres. We select the zero of potential to be at infinity, the point at which there is no potential.\nThen the potential difference $\\Delta V$ between the two spheres is:\n$\\Delta V =-\\int E.dr$ from $R_{2}$ to $R_{1}$,\nHere the electric field is radial so we can rewrite this to:\n$\\Delta V =-\\int E(r).dr$ from $R_{2}$ to $R_{1}$\nIntegrating from $R_{2}$ to $R_{1}$:\n$\\Delta V=\\int_{R_{2}}^{R_{1}}\\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}r^{2}}dr$\n$\\Delta V=\\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}\\int_{R_{2}}^{R_{1}}\\frac{1}{r^{2}}dr=\\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}[-\\frac{1}{r}]_{R_{2}}^{R_{1}}$\n$\\Delta V=\\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}[\\frac{1}{R_{1}}-\\frac{1}{R_{2}}]$\nExplanation:\nHere, $\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}} = 9\\times10^{9}$ and to convert $cm$ to $m$ divide it by 100\n\n**Step 3**\n(3) Now, we can find the capacitance using this formula:\n$C = \\frac{Q}{\\Delta V}$\n$C=\\frac{Q}{\\frac{Q}{2.35\\times10^{11}}}$\n$C = 4.25\\times10^{-12}F$\n$C = 4.25\\ picoF$\n\n**Answer**\n(1) Magnitude of electric field is $E(r)=\\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}r^{2}}$\n(2) Electric - field expression is $\\Delta V=\\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}[\\frac{1}{R_{1}}-\\frac{1}{R_{2}}]$\n(3) The capacitance is $4.25\\times10^{-12}F$"

    "answer": "**Solution**\n\n**Step 1**\n**Part 1: (a, b, c, d)**\n(a) **Symmetry and the Electric Field**\nThe horizontal - electric - field components at the semicircle center cancel because each $dq$ charge distribution contains an opposite $dq$ charge element exactly across. Because the horizontal parts of both charge elements have matching strength and opposite direction they balance out completely.\nEach field component at the center only contributes through vertical projection. The composite electric - field vector lies only in the vertical $y$ - axis.\n(b) **Coordinate System and Integration Variable**\nA polar coordinate system is most appropriate, with the origin at the center of the semicircle. The angle $\\theta$, measured from the vertical axis, is the most convenient variable for integration because the semicircle is symmetric around this axis. The angle $\\theta$ varies from $-\\pi/2$ to $\\pi/2$.\n(c) **Writing $dq$**\nThe total charge $Q$ is uniformly distributed along the semicircle's length $l=\\pi R$.

The contact areas oppose this compressive force, and the stress produced is the bearing stress.\n   - **Explanation**:\n     - The bearing stress, $\\sigma_{bearing}$, is determined by $\\sigma_{bearing}=\\frac{F}{A}$, where $F$ is the force and $A$ is the contact area.\n\n### Step 2\n2. **why is disk C experiencing shear stress?**\n   - **Explanation**:\n     - Shear stress occurs when a force attempts to create sliding between layers of a material.\n     - In the case of disk C, the force exerted by the upper disks is transferred to be applied over its horizontal plane, at the interface with the ground, i.e., support. Compression is not the sole resistance but a horizontal component of resistance in the material.\n     - If the support or the disk cannot resist the shear force, then it undergoes shear failure. Shear stress, $\\tau$, is calculated as follows, $\\tau=\\frac{F}{A_{shear}}$, where $F$ is the force and $A_{shear}$ is the shear area, which in most cases would be the cross - sectional area perpendicular to the force.\n\n### Step 3\n3. **why is the failure mode different for disk C?**\n   - Disk C fails in shear because:\n     - 1. It is the last layer in the system, in direct contact with the fixed support (ground), the load must be transferred horizontally to the support to achieve equilibrium.\n     - 2. The vertical load from the disks above generates horizontal shear stresses at the interface between disk C and the ground.\n     - 3. If the material of disk C or the support cannot resist these shear stresses, shear failure occurs at the interface.\n   - In contrast, disks A and B are not directly subjected to horizontal force components; instead, they experience vertical compressive stresses.\n\n### Step 4\n4. **free body diagram explanation**\n   - **disk A**:\n     - Downward force is 140kN.\n     - Disk B reaction is upward compressive force, resulting in bearing stress at the interface with disk B.\n   - **disk B**:\n     - Downward force is 140kN from disk A.\n     - Reaction from disk C is upward compressive force, resulting in bearing stress at the interface with disk C.\n   - **disk C**:\n     - Downward force is 140kN.\n     - Shear force at its interface with the support to resist sliding, leads to shear failure because of horizontal force transfer.\n\n### Answer\nA and B will experience bearing stress because of the vertical compression from the applied 140 kN load. The disk C will experience shear stress at its interface with the support, which may cause shear failure due to horizontal force transfer."

Since this is a uniformly accelerated motion, we can use the equation:\n$v_f^{2}=v_i^{2}+2ad$\nwhere $v_f$ is the final velocity and $d$ is the distance traveled.

    "answer": "Determine the mass (m) that should be suspended on each side of the string to create a standing wave with four nodes and three anti - nodes at a frequency of 408 Hz.\nGiven parameters:\nLength of the string $L = 0.306\\ m$, linear mass density $\\mu=3.94\\times 10^{-3}\\ kg/m$, frequency $f = 408\\ Hz$\n\n1. **Finding the Wave Mode in the String**:\n   - The string forms with four nodes and three anti - nodes. The number of half - wavelengths in the string is equal to the number of anti - nodes, so $n = 3$.\n   - For a string fixed at both ends, the fundamental wavelength $\\lambda$ is determined by $L=n\\frac{\\lambda}{2}$, so $\\lambda=\\frac{2L}{n}$. Substituting $L = 0.306\\ m$ and $n = 3$, we get $\\lambda=\\frac{2\\times0.306}{3}=0.204\\ m$.\n2. **Calculating the Wave Speed (v)**:\n   - The wave speed $v$ in the string is related to the frequency $f$ and wavelength $\\lambda$ by the wave equation $v = f\\lambda$. Substituting $f = 408\\ Hz$ and $\\lambda=0.204\\ m$, we get $v=f\\lambda=408\\times0.204 = 83.232\\ m/s$.\n3. **Relating Wave Speed to Tension (T)**:\n   - The wave speed $v$ in a string is also given by $v=\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}$, where $T$ is the tension in the string and $\\mu$ is the linear mass density. Rearranging for $T$, we get $T=\\mu v^{2}$. Substituting $\\mu = 3.94\\times 10^{-3}\\ kg/m$ and $v = 83.232\\ m/s$, we have $T=(3.94\\times 10^{-3})(83.232)^{2}\\approx27.1\\ N$.\n4. **Finding the Required Mass**:\n   - The tension $T$ in the string is provided by the weight of the suspended masses, $T = mg$ (where $g = 9.8\\ m/s^{2}$). Rearranging for $m$, we get $m=\\frac{T}{g}$. Substituting $T\\approx27.1\\ N$ and $g = 9.8\\ m/s^{2}$, we find $m=\\frac{27.1}{9.8}\\approx2.77\\ kg\\approx2.78\\ kg$.\n\nAnswer: The mass on each side of the string is $2.78\\ kg$ when a standing wave with four nodes and three anti - nodes occurs at $408\\ Hz$."
