    "options":"A. Step 1 Given imp info -> Two discs with the same mass (m) and radius (r) $I_0$ is the moment of inertia of each disc with respect to its center of mass. Massless springs with a spring - constant of k connect them. On a plane that is inclined with angle $\\theta$ When under gravity, g Explanation: The discs' centers are shown by points P and Q. Our coordinate system is the distance along the incline. Refer to P and Q's locations as $x_1$ and $x_2$, respectively. The slope is going in a positive direction. Step 2 Each disc's forces: Component of gravity along an incline: $mg\\sin\\theta$ spring pressures resulting from interconnected springs Explanation: Normal force, which is perpendicular to the slope and has no effect on motion along it Rolling without sliding is caused by friction. In order to roll without slipping: Angular acceleration $\\alpha$ and linear acceleration a are connected by the formula $a = r\\alpha$. $\\tau=I_0\\alpha$ for a rolling disc, where $\\tau$ is the torque. Step 3 1. For disc P (upper disc, $x_1$): - Force equation: $m(\\frac{d^{2}x_1}{dt^{2}})=mg\\sin\\theta - k(x_1)+k(x_2 - x_1)$ 2. For disc Q (lower disc, $x_2$): - Force equation: $m(\\frac{d^{2}x_2}{dt^{2}})=mg\\sin\\theta - k(x_2 - x_1)$ 3. Due to rolling constraint: - $I_0\\frac{d^{2}\\varphi_1}{dt^{2}} = F_{r1}$ (for disc P) - $I_0\\frac{d^{2}\\varphi_2}{dt^{2}} = F_{r2}$ (for disc Q) Explanation: where $\\varphi_1$ and $\\varphi_2$ are angular displacements and $F_{r1}$, $F_{r2}$ are friction forces Therefore, the final equations of motion are: $\\left(m + \\frac{I_0}{r^{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{d^{2}x_1}{dt^{2}}\\right)=mg\\sin\\theta - k(x_1)+k(x_2 - x_1)$ $\\left(m+\\frac{I_0}{r^{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{d^{2}x_2}{dt^{2}}\\right)=mg\\sin\\theta - k(x_2 - x_1)$ These are coupled second - order differential equations describing the motion of the two - disc system. Answer Therefore, the final equations of motion are: $\\left(m + \\frac{I_0}{r^{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{d^{2}x_1}{dt^{2}}\\right)=mg\\sin\\theta - k(x_1)+k(x_2 - x_1)$ $\\left(m+\\frac{I_0}{r^{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{d^{2}x_2}{dt^{2}}\\right)=mg\\sin\\theta - k(x_2 - x_1)$\n\nB. To find the equations of motion for the two discs, we need to consider both the translational and rotational motion of each disc, as well as the forces exerted by the springs. Step 1: Define the variables and forces Let \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) be the positions of the centers of mass of discs P and Q, respectively, along the incline. The angle of the incline is \\( \\theta \\). The forces acting on each disc are: 1. Gravitational force components along the incline: \\( mg \\sin \\theta \\) for each disc. 2. Spring forces: For disc P, the spring force from the wall is \\( kx_1 \\) (assuming the unstretched length of the spring is zero for simplicity), and the spring force from the other spring is \\( k(x_2 - x_1 - l_0) \\), where \\( l_0 \\) is the natural length of the spring between the discs. For disc Q, the spring force from the other disc is \\( k(x_1 - x_2 + l_0) \\). Step 2: Write the translational equations of motion For disc P: \\[ m \\ddot{x}_1 = mg \\sin \\theta - kx_1 - k(x_2 - x_1 - l_0) = mg \\sin \\theta - kx_1 - kx_2 + kx_1 + kl_0 = mg \\sin \\theta - kx_2 + kl_0 \\] Simplifying, we get: \\[ m \\ddot{x}_1 = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_2 - x_1 - l_0) \\] \\[ m \\ddot{x}_1 = mg \\sin \\theta - kx_2 + kx_1 + kl_0 \\] \\[ m \\ddot{x}_1 = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_1 - x_2 + l_0) \\] For disc Q: \\[ m \\ddot{x}_2 = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_1 - x_2 + l_0) \\] Step 3: Write the rotational equations of motion The torque on each disc is due to the frictional force that causes rolling without slipping. The torque on disc P is: \\[ I_0 \\ddot{\\theta}_1 = r F_{\\text{fric},1} \\] Since the discs are rolling without slipping, \\( \\ddot{x}_1 = r \\ddot{\\theta}_1 \\), so: \\[ I_0 \\frac{\\ddot{x}_1}{r} = r F_{\\text{fric},1} \\] \\[ F_{\\text{fric},1} = \\frac{I_0 \\ddot{x}_1}{r^2} \\] Similarly, for disc Q: \\[ F_{\\text{fric},2} = \\frac{I_0 \\ddot{x}_2}{r^2} \\] The frictional forces are also the horizontal components of the normal reaction forces minus the gravitational component: \\[ F_{\\text{fric},1} = m g \\sin \\theta - k(x_2 - x_1 - l_0) - m \\ddot{x}_1 \\] \\[ F_{\\text{fric},2} = m g \\sin \\theta - k(x_1 - x_2 + l_0) - m \\ddot{x}_2 \\] Combining the translational and rotational equations, we get the final equations of motion: \\[ m \\ddot{x}_1 = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_1 - x_2 + l_0) \\] \\[ m \\ddot{x}_2 = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_1 - x_2 + l_0) \\] So the equations of motion are: \\[ \\boxed{m \\ddot{x}_1 = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_1 - x_2 + l_0)} \\] \\[ \\boxed{m \\ddot{x}_2 = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_1 - x_2 + l_0)} \\]\n\nC. To find the equations of motion for the two discs attached by massless springs on an inclined plane, we need to apply Newton's second law to both the translational and rotational motion of the discs. Let's denote the positions of the discs along the incline as \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) for disc \\( P \\) and disc \\( Q \\) respectively. The angle of the incline is \\( \\theta \\). Step 1: Translational Motion For disc \\( P \\), the forces acting are: - The component of gravity along the incline: \\( mg \\sin \\theta \\). - The spring force from the spring attached to the wall: \\( -kx_1 \\). - The spring force from the spring attached to disc \\( Q \\): \\( k(x_2 - x_1 - l_0) \\). The net force along the incline for disc \\( P \\) is: \\[ F_{\\text{net}, P} = mg \\sin \\theta - kx_1 + k(x_2 - x_1 - l_0) \\] \\[ F_{\\text{net}, P} = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_2 - 2x_1 - l_0) \\] By Newton's second law, the equation of motion for the translational motion of disc \\( P \\) is: \\[ m \\frac{d^2 x_1}{dt^2} = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_2 - 2x_1 - l_0) \\] For disc \\( Q \\), the forces acting are: - The component of gravity along the incline: \\( mg \\sin \\theta \\). - The spring force from the spring attached to disc \\( P \\): \\( -k(x_2 - x_1 - l_0) \\). The net force along the incline for disc \\( Q \\) is: \\[ F_{\\text{net}, Q} = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_2 - x_1 - l_0) \\] By Newton's second law, the equation of motion for the translational motion of disc \\( Q \\) is: \\[ m \\frac{d^2 x_2}{dt^2} = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_2 - x_1 - l_0) \\] Step 2: Rotational Motion For each disc, the torque due to the friction that causes rolling without slipping is given by: \\[ \\tau = I_0 \\alpha = I_0 \\frac{a}{r} \\] where \\( \\alpha \\) is the angular acceleration and \\( a \\) is the linear acceleration. The frictional force \\( f \\) provides the torque: \\[ \\tau = f r \\] \\[ f r = I_0 \\frac{a}{r} \\] \\[ f = \\frac{I_0}{r^2} a \\] The forces of friction and the net force provide the translational acceleration: \\[ m a = mg \\sin \\theta + \\text{(spring forces)} - f \\] \\[ m a = mg \\sin \\theta + \\text{(spring forces)} - \\frac{I_0}{r^2} a \\] \\[ \\left( m + \\frac{I_0}{r^2} \\right) a = mg \\sin \\theta + \\text{(spring forces)} \\] Final Equations of Motion Combining these, the final equations of motion are: \\[ \\left( m + \\frac{I_0}{r^2} \\right) \\frac{d^2 x_1}{dt^2} = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_2 - 2x_1 - l_0) \\] \\[ \\left( m + \\frac{I_0}{r^2} \\right) \\frac{d^2 x_2}{dt^2} = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_2 - x_1 - l_0) \\] The final form of the equations of motion is: \\[ \\boxed{\\left( m + \\frac{I_0}{r^2} \\right) \\frac{d^2 x_1}{dt^2} = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_2 - 2x_1 - l_0)} \\] \\[ \\left( m + \\frac{I_0}{r^2} \\right) \\frac{d^2 x_2}{dt^2} = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_2 - x_1 - l_0) \\]\n\nD. To find the equations of motion for the two discs rolling on the hill, we need to apply Newton's second law for both translational and rotational motion. We'll also consider the forces and torques acting on each disc. Step 1: Define the variables - Let \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) be the displacements of the centers of mass of discs \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) along the incline, respectively. - Let \\( \\theta_1 \\) and \\( \\theta_2 \\) be the angular displacements of discs \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\), respectively. Step 2: Write down the forces and torques For each disc, the forces acting are: 1. The component of gravity along the incline: \\( mg \\sin \\theta \\) 2. The spring force from the left spring \\( -k(x_1 - \\ell_0) \\) (for disc \\( P \\)) 3. The spring force from the right spring \\( k(x_2 - x_1 - \\ell_0) \\) (for disc \\( P \\)) 4. The spring force from the right spring \\( -k(x_2 - x_1 - \\ell_0) \\) (for disc \\( Q \\)) The net force along the incline for each disc can be written as: \\[ F_{1\\text{,net}} = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_1 - \\ell_0) + k(x_2 - x_1 - \\ell_0) \\] \\[ F_{2\\text{,net}} = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_2 - x_1 - \\ell_0) \\] Since the discs are rolling without slipping, the translational and rotational motions are related by \\( x_i = r \\theta_i \\) for \\( i = 1, 2 \\). Step 3: Apply Newton's second law for translation For disc \\( P \\): \\[ m \\ddot{x}_1 = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_1 - \\ell_0) + k(x_2 - x_1 - \\ell_0) \\] \\[ m \\ddot{x}_1 = mg \\sin \\theta - kx_1 + k\\ell_0 + kx_2 - kx_1 - k\\ell_0 \\] \\[ m \\ddot{x}_1 = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_2 - 2x_1) \\] For disc \\( Q \\): \\[ m \\ddot{x}_2 = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_2 - x_1 - \\ell_0) \\] \\[ m \\ddot{x}_2 = mg \\sin \\theta - kx_2 + kx_1 + k\\ell_0 \\] \\[ m \\ddot{x}_2 = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_1 - x_2) \\] Step 4: Apply Newton's second law for rotation The torque for each disc due to the spring forces is: For disc \\( P \\): \\[ \\tau_1 = r \\left( -k(x_1 - \\ell_0) + k(x_2 - x_1 - \\ell_0) \\right) \\] \\[ I_0 \\ddot{\\theta}_1 = r \\left( -kx_1 + k\\ell_0 + kx_2 - kx_1 - k\\ell_0 \\right) \\] \\[ I_0 \\ddot{\\theta}_1 = r k (x_2 - 2x_1) \\] Since \\( x_1 = r \\theta_1 \\), \\( \\ddot{x}_1 = r \\ddot{\\theta}_1 \\), so \\( \\ddot{\\theta}_1 = \\frac{\\ddot{x}_1}{r} \\): \\[ I_0 \\frac{\\ddot{x}_1}{r} = r k (x_2 - 2x_1) \\] \\[ I_0 \\ddot{x}_1 = r^2 k (x_2 - 2x_1) \\] For disc \\( Q \\): \\[ \\tau_2 = r \\left( -k(x_2 - x_1 - \\ell_0) \\right) \\] \\[ I_0 \\ddot{\\theta}_2 = r \\left( -kx_2 + kx_1 + k\\ell_0 \\right) \\] \\[ I_0 \\frac{\\ddot{x}_2}{r} = r \\left( -kx_2 + kx_1 + k\\ell_0 \\right) \\] \\[ I_0 \\ddot{x}_2 = r^2 k (x_1 - x_2) \\] Step 5: Combine the equations We have the following system of equations: \\[ m \\ddot{x}_1 = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_2 - 2x_1) \\] \\[ m \\ddot{x}_2 = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_1 - x_2) \\] \\[ I_0 \\ddot{x}_1 = r^2 k (x_2 - 2x_1) \\] \\[ I_0 \\ddot{x}_2 = r^2 k (x_1 - x_2) \\] The final equations of motion are: \\[ \\boxed{m \\ddot{x}_1 = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_2 - 2x_1), \\quad m \\ddot{x}_2 = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_1 - x_2), \\quad I_0 \\ddot{x}_1 = r^2 k (x_2 - 2x_1), \\quad I_0 \\ddot{x}_2 = r^2 k (x_1 - x_2)} \\]",

    "parsing":"This problem involves a car traveling through a straight tunnel between New York and San - Francisco. We consider two scenarios: one without friction and Earth's rotation, and the other with friction proportional to the square of the velocity.\n\n### Time Calculation Without Friction\nThe tunnel length $L = 5000\\ km=5\\times10^{6}\\ m$, the acceleration due to gravity $g = 980\\ cm\/s^{2}=9.8\\ m\/s^{2}$, and the radius of the Earth $R = 6400\\ km = 6.4\\times10^{6}\\ m$.\nWe can model the car's motion as a particle moving through a tunnel through the Earth, where the gravitational force changes as the car moves. Assuming the car is released from rest, it experiences a gravitational force directed toward the center of the Earth.\nThe acceleration at any point along the tunnel is given by $a(x)=-\\frac{g}{R}x$, where $x$ is the distance from the center of the Earth.\nTo calculate the total time for the car to travel the $5000 - km$ tunnel, we use conservation of mechanical energy. The kinetic energy at any point $K=\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$ and the potential - energy loss $U = mgx$.\nThe time $t$ to travel a small distance $dx$ is $dt=\\frac{dx}{v(x)}$, so the total time $t$ for the car to travel from New York to San Francisco is:\n$$ t = \\sqrt{2R}\\int_{x_1}^{x_2}\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{R^{2}-x^{2}}} $$\nwhere $x_1 = 0$ (New York) and $x_2 = L$ (San Francisco).\n$$ t=\\sqrt{2R}\\left[\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{x}{R}\\right)\\right]_0^L = \\sqrt{2R}\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{L}{R}\\right) $$\nSubstituting $L = 5\\times10^{6}\\ m$ and $R = 6.4\\times10^{6}\\ m$ and $g = 9.8\\ m\/s^{2}$, we get $t\\approx 23.8$ minutes.\n\n### Motion with Friction Proportional to the Velocity Squared\nThe frictional force proportional to the square of the velocity is $F_{friction}=-kv^{2}$.\nThe motion of the car is governed by Newton's second law: $ma=-mg + kv^{2}$, or $a = - g+\\frac{k}{m}v^{2}$.\nThis is a first - order differential equation, and the solution depends on the initial conditions. Solving for the velocity $v(t)$ as a function of time in phase space involves more complex mathematics.\nWe can rewrite the differential equation as $\\frac{dv}{-g+\\frac{k}{m}v^{2}}=dt$.\nThe solution of this differential equation involves integration and depends on the friction constant $k$ (the constant of proportionality of the friction). Without the value of $k$, we cannot proceed with an exact numerical solution for $v(t)$. However, we know that friction will significantly reduce the acceleration, and the motion will be non - uniform. The velocity will approach a steady value once the gravitational and frictional forces balance.\n\n### Answer\n**Without Friction**:\nThe time for the car to travel through the tunnel, neglecting friction and Earth's rotation, is approximately $t\\approx23.8$ minutes.\n\n**With Friction**:\nWhen friction proportional to the square of the velocity is introduced, the motion is described by a non - linear differential equation. The velocity decreases over time due to the frictional force, and the time to travel through the tunnel cannot be determined exactly without the value of the friction constant $k$.\n![](images\/78b722e377286dc5b2bcf39ba8175ddb378bad6b27ee876566faa0e536e9ff30.jpg)"

    "parsing":"**Solution**\n\n**Step 1**\n**Introduction**\nIt is the importance of understanding an efficient force as a significant aspect of physics, a multidirectional provision for how multiple forces interact with an object. From this standpoint, if an object is in a system where more forces act on it, then single great force can be considered for all these forces. This single force will then be enhanced with the right vector identity, giving both the magnitude as well as direction.\n\n**Explanation**:\nThis is done after breaking each force into the horizontal and vertical components of the force. The components now become added up. Systematic consideration of the forces thus ensures that an accurate assessment of the resultant force is made; an important factor in a simple assessment of forces and how they affect the whole body.\n\n**Step 2**\n1. **Resolve Forces into Components**\nEach force can be broken into horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components:\n   - For Force $F_A$:\n     - $F_{Ax}=F_A\\cos(64^{\\circ})$, $F_{Ay}=F_A\\sin(64^{\\circ})$.\n     - Substituting $F_A = 8\\ kN$:\n       - $F_{Ax}=8\\cos(64^{\\circ})=8\\times0.4384 = 3.507\\ kN$,\n       - $F_{Ay}=8\\sin(64^{\\circ})=8\\times0.8988 = 7.190\\ kN$.\n   - For Force $F_B$:\n     - $F_{Bx}=F_B\\cos(40^{\\circ})$, $F_{By}=-F_B\\sin(40^{\\circ})$.\n     - (Note that $F_B$ has a downward - vertical component, so $F_{By}$ is negative.) Substituting $F_B = 6\\ kN$:\n       - $F_{Bx}=6\\cos(40^{\\circ})=6\\times0.7660 = 4.596\\ kN$,\n       - $F_{By}=-6\\sin(40^{\\circ})=-6\\times0.6428=-3.857\\ kN$.\n2. **Calculate the Resultant Components**\nThe resultant force components are the sum of the respective components of $F_A$ and $F_B$:\n   - Horizontal Component $F_{Rx}$:\n     - $F_{Rx}=F_{Ax}+F_{Bx}=3.507 + 4.596=8.103\\ kN$.\n   - Vertical Component $F_{Ry}$:\n     - $F_{Ry}=F_{Ay}+F_{By}=7.190-3.857 = 3.333\\ kN$.\n3. **Calculate the Magnitude of the Resultant Force**\nThe magnitude $F_R$ of the resultant force is given by:\n$$ F_R=\\sqrt{(F_{Rx})^2+(F_{Ry})^2} $$\nSubstitute the values:\n$$ F_R=\\sqrt{(8.103)^2+(3.333)^2}=\\sqrt{65.66 + 11.11}=\\sqrt{76.77} $$\n$$ F_R = 8.76\\ kN $$\n4. **Calculate the Direction of the Resultant Force**\nThe direction $\\theta_R$ is the angle of the resultant force measured clockwise from the horizontal:\n$$ \\theta_R=\\tan^{- 1}\\left(\\frac{F_{Ry}}{F_{Rx}}\\right) $$\nSubstitute the values:\n$$ \\theta_R=\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3.333}{8.103}\\right)=\\tan^{-1}(0.4112) $$\n$$ \\theta_R = 22.4^{\\circ} $$\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe forces were acting on the object at various angles. By breaking these forces into their horizontal and vertical parts and combining these components they were able to express the total effect on the object. By doing this the whole system is being accounted for, allowing a somewhat accurate deduction of the average force.\n\n**Answer**\nThe magnitude of the resultant force acting on the object is $8.76\\ kN$, and the direction is at an angle of $22.4^{\\circ}$ clockwise from horizontal. Those are the values of the total effect provided by the two forces in question. They represent clearly how the aforesaid forces might effect behavior and critiqued dissipation of an object."

    "parsing":"Given,\nInitial position of object, $x = 0m$\n(a)\nExplanation:\nWe have to describe that how the object changes its motion with the given interval of time.\nFrom diagram, we can see the object is at rest from $t = 0s$ to $t = 2s$ and then it moves to right in upward direction with a constant velocity of $1\\frac{m}{s}$ and positive acceleration from $t = 2s$ to $t = 4s$. Again, the object start to moves with negative acceleration from the next time interval $t = 4s$ to $t = 6s$.\n\nStep 2\n(b)\nExplanation:\nThe displacement from $t = 2s$ to $t = 6s$ can be calculated by the area under the given curve and the diagram.

Calculate the total resistance in the circuit.

Because the weight is now submerged, it displaces a volume of water, but flipping the arrangement upside - down has no effect on the buoyant force.\nThe Styrofoam needs to displace less water to balance the weight of the system when the gold is underneath because the gold is submerged, which lowers the total amount of water that the Styrofoam must displace.\nTrue statement : (2)The waterline is now below the top surface of the Styrofoam.\n\nStep 2\nWhen the gold is submerged, it moves its own amount of water instead of depending only on the Styrofoam.\nExplanation:\nSince the gold is now submerged, the water level drops because it displaces water equal to its own volume, which is less than the volume that the Styrofoam displaced while the gold was on top.\nTrue statement:\n(2)The water level in the container drops.\n\nAnswer\nAnswers\na.

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information step-by-step. Since the actual graph is not provided in the text, I'll proceed with a generic approach based on standard simple harmonic motion (SHM) relationships.\\n\\n### Step 1: Determine the Gradient\\nFor a particle undergoing simple harmonic motion, the relationship between acceleration \\\\(a\\\\) and displacement \\\\(x\\\\) is given by:\\n\\\\[ a = -\\\\omega^2 x \\\\]\\nwhere \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency.\\n\\nThe gradient of the graph \\\\(a\\\\) vs. \\\\(x\\\\) is equal to \\\\(-\\\\omega^2\\\\). To find the gradient, you would typically calculate:\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{Gradient} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta a}{\\\\Delta x} \\\\]\\n\\nAssuming the graph shows a linear relationship where the maximum acceleration \\\\(a_{\\\\text{max}}\\\\) corresponds to the maximum displacement \\\\(x_{\\\\text{max}}\\\\), the gradient can be calculated as:\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{Gradient} = -\\\\frac{a_{\\\\text{max}}}{x_{\\\\text{max}}} \\\\]\\n\\nLet's assume the graph shows \\\\(a_{\\\\text{max}} = -20 \\\\ \\\\text{m\/s}^2\\\\) and \\\\(x_{\\\\text{max}} = 0.25 \\\\ \\\\text{m}\\\\):\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{Gradient} = -\\\\frac{-20}{0.25} = 80 \\\\ \\\\text{s}^{-2} \\\\]\\n\\nThus, the gradient is:\\n\\\\[ \\\\boxed{80} \\\\]\\n\\n### Step 2: Calculate the Frequency\\nThe gradient is \\\\(-\\\\omega^2\\\\), so:\\n\\\\[ \\\\omega^2 = 80 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ \\\\omega = \\\\sqrt{80} = 4\\\\sqrt{5} \\\\ \\\\text{rad\/s} \\\\]\\n\\nThe frequency \\\\(f\\\\) is related to the angular frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) by:\\n\\\\[ f = \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2\\\\pi} \\\\]\\n\\\\[ f = \\\\frac{4\\\\sqrt{5}}{2\\\\pi} = \\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{5}}{\\\\pi} \\\\ \\\\text{Hz} \\\\]\\n\\nThus, the frequency is:\\n\\\\[ \\\\boxed{\\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{5}}{\\\\pi}} \\\\]\\n\\n### Step 3: Determine the Period\\nThe period \\\\(T\\\\) is the reciprocal of the frequency:\\n\\\\[ T = \\\\frac{1}{f} = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2\\\\sqrt{5}} \\\\ \\\\text{s} \\\\]\\n\\nThus, the period is:\\n\\\\[ \\\\boxed{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2\\\\sqrt{5}}} \\\\]\\n\\n### Step 4: Sketch the Graph of Acceleration vs Time\\nGiven that the displacement is zero and the velocity is positive at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), the acceleration at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) is also zero. The acceleration \\\\(a\\\\) varies sinusoidally with time. We can represent this as:\\n\\\\[ a(t) = -a_{\\\\text{max}} \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) \\\\]\\n\\nThe maximum acceleration \\\\(a_{\\\\text{max}} = 20 \\\\ \\\\text{m\/s}^2\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega = 4\\\\sqrt{5} \\\\ \\\\text{rad\/s}\\\\).\\n\\nThe time period \\\\(T = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2\\\\sqrt{5}} \\\\ \\\\text{s}\\\\) for one complete cycle.\\n\\nTo sketch the graph for at least two complete cycles, we need to extend the time axis from \\\\(0\\\\) to \\\\(2T\\\\). The amplitude of the acceleration will be \\\\(20 \\\\ \\\\text{m\/s}^2\\\\), varying sinusoidally between \\\\(-20 \\\\ \\\\text{m\/s}^2\\\\) and \\\\(20 \\\\ \\\\text{m\/s}^2\\\\).\\n\\nHere's a rough sketch of the graph with labeled axes (note that this is a textual representation; you can use the provided grid to create the actual sketch):\\n\\n- \\\\(a\\\\) on the y-axis, ranging from \\\\(-20\\\\) to \\\\(20 \\\\ \\\\text{m\/s}^2\\\\).\\n- \\\\(t\\\\) on the x-axis, ranging from \\\\(0\\\\) to \\\\(2T\\\\) where \\\\(2T = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{\\\\sqrt{5}} \\\\ \\\\text{s}\\\\).\\n\\nThe graph will look like a cosine wave starting from zero and cycling through two complete periods.\n\nD. To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:\\n\\n### Step 1: Calculate the Gradient of the Graph\\nThe graph shows the relationship between acceleration \\\\(a\\\\) and displacement \\\\(x\\\\) for a particle undergoing simple harmonic motion. The relationship is given by \\\\(a = -\\\\omega^2 x\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. The gradient of the graph is the coefficient of \\\\(x\\\\), which is \\\\(-\\\\omega^2\\\\).\\n\\nLet's assume from the graph that the maximum acceleration \\\\(a_{\\\\text{max}}\\\\) is 10 units and the maximum displacement \\\\(x_{\\\\text{max}}\\\\) is 2 units. The gradient of the graph is the slope of the line, which is:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{Gradient} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta a}{\\\\Delta x} = \\\\frac{-10 \\\\text{ units}}{2 \\\\text{ units}} = -5\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSo, the gradient is \\\\(-5\\\\). This means \\\\(-\\\\omega^2 = -5\\\\), so \\\\(\\\\omega^2 = 5\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega = \\\\sqrt{5}\\\\).\\n\\n### Step 2: Deducing the Frequency\\nThe frequency \\\\(f\\\\) is related to the angular frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) by the equation:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\omega = 2\\\\pi f\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSo,\\n\\n\\\\[\\nf = \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2\\\\pi} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}}{2\\\\pi}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n### Step 3: Calculate the Period\\nThe period \\\\(T\\\\) is the reciprocal of the frequency:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nT = \\\\frac{1}{f} = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\sqrt{5}}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n### Step 4: Sketch the Graph of Acceleration vs Time\\nThe acceleration \\\\(a\\\\) as a function of time \\\\(t\\\\) for simple harmonic motion is given by:\\n\\n\\\\[\\na(t) = -\\\\omega^2 A \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSince the displacement is zero and the velocity is positive at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), the particle is passing through the equilibrium position and moving to the positive direction. This means the cosine function will be zero at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and the sine function will be maximum. So, the acceleration will be:\\n\\n\\\\[\\na(t) = -\\\\omega^2 A \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) = -5 A \\\\cos(\\\\sqrt{5} t)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nWe can sketch the graph with two complete cycles. The period \\\\(T = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\sqrt{5}} \\\\approx 2.82\\\\) seconds. So, two complete cycles will be \\\\(2 \\\\times 2.82 = 5.64\\\\) seconds. We can choose the amplitude of the acceleration to be 10 units for simplicity.\\n\\nThe graph will look like a cosine wave that is inverted (negative cosine wave) with amplitude 10 units and period 2.82 seconds.\\n\\nThe final answers are:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{-5}\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}}{2\\\\pi}}\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\sqrt{5}}}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nAnd the sketch of the graph of acceleration against time is a negative cosine wave with amplitude 10 units and period 2.82 seconds.",

    "parsing":"**Introduction**\n\nThe problem at hand is to determine the initial speed ($v_0$) required for a basketball player to shoot a basketball through the center of the rim. The player shoots the basketball at an angle of $36^{\\circ}$ from a height of 7 feet. The rim is located 13 feet 9 inches horizontally from the player and is 10 feet high. We need to use the principles of projectile - motion to find the necessary initial velocity ($v_0$) that will cause the ball to pass through the center of the rim.\n\n**Using the Equations for Projectile Motion**\n\n**For Horizontal Motion**:\nIn projectile motion, the horizontal distance traveled by the ball is given by the equation $x = v_0\\cos(\\theta)\\cdot t$. Here, $x$ is the horizontal distance from the player to the rim, $v_0$ is the initial velocity, $\\theta$ is the launch angle, and $t$ is the time of flight.\nSolving this equation for $t$, we get $t=\\frac{x}{v_0\\cos(\\theta)}$. Substituting $x = 13.75$ feet (13 feet 9 inches converted to feet), and $\\theta = 36^{\\circ}$ into the equation, we have $t=\\frac{13.75}{v_0\\cos(36^{\\circ})}$. This gives us the time of flight ($t$) in terms of the initial velocity ($v_0$).\n\n**For Vertical Motion**:\nThe vertical motion is governed by the equation $y - y_0=v_0\\sin(\\theta)\\cdot t-\\frac{1}{2}gt^{2}$. Here, $y_0$ (7 feet) is the initial height of the ball, $y$ (10 feet) is the final height of the ball when it reaches the rim, $g = 32.2\\ ft\/s^{2}$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $t$ is the time of flight, which we already expressed in terms of ($v_0$).\nSubstituting $y = 10$ feet, $y_0 = 7$ feet, and $t=\\frac{13.75}{v_0\\cos(36^{\\circ})}$ into the vertical - motion equation, we get $10 - 7=v_0\\sin(36^{\\circ})\\cdot\\frac{13.75}{v_0\\cos(36^{\\circ})}-\\frac{1}{2}g(\\frac{13.75}{v_0\\cos(36^{\\circ})})^{2}$.\n\n**Solving for ($v_0$)**\n\n**Simplify the Vertical Motion Equation**\nFirst, note that $\\frac{\\sin(36^{\\circ})}{\\cos(36^{\\circ})}=\\tan(36^{\\circ})\\approx0.7265$ and $\\cos(36^{\\circ})\\approx0.8090$.\nThe vertical - motion equation $10 - 7=v_0\\sin(36^{\\circ})\\cdot\\frac{13.75}{v_0\\cos(36^{\\circ})}-\\frac{1}{2}g(\\frac{13.75}{v_0\\cos(36^{\\circ})})^{2}$ becomes $3 = 13.75\\tan(36^{\\circ})-\\frac{1}{2}\\times32.2\\times(\\frac{13.75}{v_0\\times0.8090})^{2}$.\nThis equation contains only one unknown ($v_0$).\n\n**Solve the Equation for ($v_0$)**\nWe can first isolate the terms involving ($v_0$) and solve numerically. After solving the resulting quadratic - like equation in terms of ($v_0$), we get the initial velocity.\nWe find the initial velocity by using the equation for horizontal motion to express the time of flight in terms of the initial velocity, then substituting this time into the vertical - motion equation to solve for the required initial speed of the shot.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe answer for the initial velocity ($v_0$) required to pass the basketball through the center of the rim is approximately $17.73\\ ft\/s$."

    "answer":"B",
    "parsing":"Step 1\nThis problem requires determination of net force on three point charges that are placed at vertices of the equilateral triangle. The charges are equal and opposite, for two of the charges are positive and one charge is negative. These forces come aligned with Coulomb's law for the charges requested between two points charges. The task here is to find out the net force acting on each charge for which the vector nature of the forces to be looked at for as well as the symmetry of the case. Since the equilateral triangle would make the distance between all charges equal, a lot of consideration would be needed while at the same time computation would require Delaunay's method would be simpler but would require equal consideration on angles and vector components.\n\nThe charges are each of 4.0\u03bcCiant and they are separated by a distance of 2.5cm. Coulomb's law defines force between two charges and as a result one total force acting on each charges can be arrived at by summing up the force experienced from the two charges. Due to the mirror image configuration of the setup, the absolute values of the forces on each charge will be of same but direction shall require the use of components of the forces. The dynamics of basic concepts of electrostatics and vector addition are illustrated using this configuration.\n\nProblem Details\n- Three point charges: Two positive, one negative.\n- Charge magnitudes: q = 4.0, \u03bcC.\n- Distance between charges: r = 2.5, cm = 0.025, m.\n- Shape: Equilateral triangle.\n\nWe need to calculate the net force experienced by each charge due to the other two.\n\nStep 1: Coulomb's Law\nThe force between two charges is given by:\n$F = k\\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$\nwhere:\n- $k = 8.99\\times10^{9},\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C^{2}}$ (Coulomb's constant),\n- $q_1,q_2$ are the charges,\n- r is the distance between the charges.\n\nSubstitute $q = 4.0,\\mu C=4.0\\times10^{- 6},C$ and $r = 0.025,m$:\n$F = 8.99\\times10^{9}\\frac{(4.0\\times10^{-6})^{2}}{(0.025)^{2}}$\n$F = 230.3,N$\n\nThis is the force between any two charges.\n\nExplanation:\nTo start with, using Coulomb's law, the force between any two charges is then computed. By replacing the charge magnitude of 4.0\u03bcC and the distance between the charges to 2.5cm, the force between two charges is analyzed to be 230.3N. The charges exert forces on each other and force in each instance may be vector addition of the two forces. For attractive charge we have let negative charge be at origin, while forces are from two positive charges and are acting along the sides of the triangle. Latitude of these forces is 60 degrees, and the total resulting force can be computed by vector addition.\n\nStep 2\nStep 2: Force Components on Each Charge\n(a) Net Force on Charge A\nCharge A (negative) experiences repulsive forces from B and C (both positive):\n- Force $F_{AB}$: Due to charge B, along AB.\n- Force $F_{AC}$: Due to charge C, along AC.\n\nThe angle between $F_{AB}$ and $F_{AC}$ is $60^{\\circ}$ (angle in an equilateral triangle).\n\nThe net force $F_{A}$ is the vector sum of $F_{AB}$ and $F_{AC}$:\n$F_{A}=\\sqrt{F_{AB}^{2}+F_{AC}^{2}+2F_{AB}F_{AC}\\cos(60^{\\circ})}$\n\nSubstitute $F_{AB}=F_{AC}=F = 230.3,N$:\n$F_{A}=\\sqrt{230.3^{2}+230.3^{2}+2(230.3)(230.3)(0.5)}$\n$F_{A}=\\sqrt{230.3^{2}(2 + 1)}$\n$F_{A}=230.3\\sqrt{3}\\approx398.7,N$\n\n(b) Net Force on Charge B and Charge C\nBy symmetry, the forces on charges B and C will have the same magnitude as the force on charge A: $F_{B}=F_{C}=F_{A}$.\n\nExplanation:\nThe symmetry of the equilateral triangle ensures that the same method can be applied to calculate the forces on the positive charges. By symmetry, the net force on each charge has the same magnitude but different directions. The final result shows that the net force experienced by each charge is approximately 398.7N.\n\nThis result underscores the importance of both symmetry and vector addition in analyzing forces in such configurations.\n\nAnswer\nThe magnitude of the net force on each charge is:\n$F = 398.7,N$"

    "answer":"D",
    "parsing":"Step 1: Analyzing the Task\nWe are asked whether the ray diagrams in the image have any faults. For diagrams without flaws, we are required to:\nExplanation:\n- Draw incident and transmitted wavefronts using a straightedge and consistent with the rays and boundary shown.\n- If possible identify in which medium the waves will travel faster; if not possible, explain why such a comparison cannot be made.\nFor diagrams with flaws:\n- Briefly explain how the physical situation shown in your problem statement is inconsistent with observed behavior (e.g. a crest remains a crest).\n\nStep 2: Evaluating Each Diagram\nDiagram 1 (Top - Left)\n1. Observation:\n - The ray enters the boundary at an angle and after refraction the ray bends toward the normal.\n - The direction of refraction indicates the wave is moving from a high velocity to a low velocity medium.\n2. Consistency Check:\n - The bending of the ray is consistent with Snell's Law: if light travels from a faster to a slower medium, the angle of refraction is smaller than the angle of incidence.\n - By no means is this a flawed diagram.\n3. Wavefronts and Speed Comparison:\n - Draw perpendicular to the rays in both media wavefronts.\n - In a second medium (slower medium) where the wave slows down, therefore, the spacing of the wave front will be closer together.\n\nDiagram 2 (Top - Right)\n1. Observation:\n - The ray is straight line at the boundary and does not bend.\n2. Consistency Check:\n - Snell's law is consistent with this. Incident on normal to the boundary, the ray continues straight (ordinary ray) regardless of the speed change.\n - There is no flaw this diagram.\n3. Wavefronts and Speed Comparison:\n - Both media will be drawn wavefronts perpendicular to the ray.\n - Because a bending does not occur so can the spacing of the wave fronts still indicate a change in speed. With closer spacing you have slower speed, and bigger spacing means that you are going much faster.\n\nDiagram 3 (Bottom - Left)\n1. Observation:\n - And suppose the ray is refracted into the boundary and, accordingly, bends away from the normal.\n - Well, this behavior suggests that the wave travels from a slower medium to a faster medium.\n2. Consistency Check:\n - The bending away from the normal aligns with Snell's Law: When light travels from a slower to a faster medium the angle of refraction is larger than the angle of incidence.\n - No flaws present.\n3. Wavefronts and Speed Comparison:\n - The second would break waves until they were no longer broken, and draw wavefronts perpendicular to the rays in both media.\n - It will have the wavefronts' distance increased, i.e. by the increase in'speed'.\n\nDiagram 4 (Bottom - Right)\n1. Observation:\n - On passing to it, the ray enters the boundary and is refracted and bent toward the normal. Upon reflection it is shown, but now the angle of reflection is made to be inaccurately smaller than the angle of incidence.\n2. Consistency Check:\n - It seems that the reflection is a violation of the Law of Reflection, as per the angle of incidence should be equal to the angle of reflection. Diagram is faulty in this sense.\n3. Flaw Description:\n - If the boundary from which the ray is reflected does not correspond to one of these two cases the reflected ray should make an angle equal to the angle with which it has entered the boundary. Although the diagram is incorrect the angle of the given reflected ray is not.\n\nStep 3: Final Summary\n1. Diagram 1: No flaw. To indicate slower speed in the second medium wavefronts can be drawn.\n2. Diagram 2: No flaw. Wave fronts can show the relative speeds of both media and the ray travels straight.\n3. Diagram 3: No flaw. The second medium faster speed is shown by wavefronts.\n4. Diagram 4: Flaw present. The Law of Reflection is violated because the angle of reflection is not equal to the angle of incidence.\n\nStep 4: Professional Tips for Drawing Wavefronts\nExplanation:\n - I always draw wavefronts perpendicular to ray direction.\n - Let's say, for example, that wavefronts in denser media (slower speed) should tend to be closer together.\n - Based on the above, in less dense media (faster speed) wavefronts are expected to be farther apart.\n\nAnswer\nFinal Answer:\n1. Diagram 1: No flaw. The ray bends towards the normal \u2014 as we would expect from travelling from a faster to slower medium. Those wavefronts in the slower medium will be 'closer together'. It is at normal incidence Snell's Law is consistent with passing straight through.\n2. Diagram 2: No flaw. At normal incidence Snell's Law is consistent with passing straight through. Relative speeds can be indicated with wavefront spacing.\n3. Diagram 3: No flaw. It bends away from the normal insofar as you will be travelling from a slower to a faster medium. In the faster medium wavefronts will be further apart.\n4. Diagram 4: Flaw present. But the angle of reflection is incorrect, it doesn't equal the angle of incidence violating the Law of Reflection."

    "parsing":"Given:\nThe astronaut's horizontal position (x(t)) and vertical position (y(t)) are plotted as functions of time (t).\nThe horizontal graph shows the astronaut's position over time.\nThe vertical graph shows the astronaut's height over time.\n\nObjective:\nPart (a): Estimate the launch speed ($v_i$) and launch angle ($\\theta$) of the astronaut using the graphs.\nPart (b): Estimate the acceleration due to gravity on the planet based on the vertical motion.\n\nExplanation:\nThe astronaut jumps on an unknown planet, and graphs show her horizontal and vertical positions. The goal is to estimate her launch speed, launch angle, and the planet's gravity based on these graphs.\n\nStep 2\nSOLUTION\nTo estimate the launch speed ($v_i$) and the launch angle ($\\theta$) the following principles of projectile motion can be applied:\n\n1. Horizontal Motion:\nThe horizontal motion is uniform with constant speed as the horizontal position (x(t)) increases linearly with time.\nFrom the graph the horizontal distance covered after $t = 0.7$ seconds (the total time of flight is approximately 0.70 seconds).\nThe horizontal speed ($v_x$) is constant and can be estimated using:\n$v_x=\\frac{x(t)}{t}$\nGiven $x(t = 0.7)=90$ cm and $t = 0.7$ s, the horizontal speed is:\n$v_x=\\frac{90}{0.7}\\approx128.57$ cm\/s\n\n2. Vertical Motion:\nThe vertical motion follows a parabolic path due to gravity.\nThe maximum height occurs when (y(t)) reaches its peak which occurs at $t\\approx0.35$ seconds (half the time of flight).\nThe vertical velocity at launch ($v_{y1}$) is given by:\n$v_{y1}=\\frac{y_{max}}{t_{peak}}$\nFrom the graph the maximum height ($y_{max}$) is approximately 20 cm and ($t_{peak}=0.35$ s). Hence the initial vertical velocity is:\n$v_{y1}=\\frac{20}{0.35}\\approx57.14$ cm\/s\n\n3. Launch Speed ($v_i$):\nThe total launch speed ($v_i$) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem since the horizontal and vertical components of velocity are independent:\n$v_i=\\sqrt{v_x^{2}+v_{y1}^{2}}$\nSubstituting the values:\n$v_i=\\sqrt{(128.57)^{2}+(57.14)^{2}}=\\sqrt{16529.61 + 3263.78}\\approx\\sqrt{19793.39}\\approx140.69$ cm\/s\n\n4. Launch Angle ($\\theta$):\nThe launch angle ($\\theta$) can be found using the relationship between the horizontal and vertical components of velocity:\n$\\tan(\\theta)=\\frac{v_{y1}}{v_x}$\nSubstituting the values:\n$\\tan(\\theta)=\\frac{57.14}{128.57}\\approx0.445$\nThus\n$\\theta=\\tan^{- 1}(0.445)\\approx24.0^{\\circ}$\n\nStep 3: Part (b) - Estimating Acceleration Due to Gravity\nTo estimate the acceleration due to gravity on this planet use the kinematic equation for vertical motion under constant acceleration:\n$y(t)=v_{y1}t-\\frac{1}{2}g\\cdot t^{2}$\nAt the peak height the vertical velocity becomes zero. Therefore the time to reach the peak height is given by:\n$t_{peak}=\\frac{v_{y1}}{g}$\nUsing $v_{y1}=57.14$ cm\/s and ($t_{peak}=0.35$ s) and solve for (g):\n$0.35=\\frac{57.14}{g}$\nThus\n$g=\\frac{57.14}{0.35}\\approx163.26$ cm\/s\u00b2 = $1.63$ m\/s\u00b2\n\nExplanation:\nIn part (a), the horizontal position graph gives the astronaut's horizontal speed, and the vertical graph provides the maximum height and time to peak. These values are used to estimate the launch speed and angle. Part (b) uses the vertical graph to calculate gravity.\n\nAnswer\nFinal Answer\nLaunch Speed ($v_i$): $\\approx140.69$ cm\/s\nLaunch Angle ($\\theta$): $\\approx24.0^{\\circ}$\nAcceleration Due to Gravity ($g$): $\\approx1.63$ m\/s\u00b2"

    "answer":"B",
    "parsing":"**Solution**\n\n**Step 1**\n**Forces due to the 2.0 nC Charges**\nEach of the 2.0 nC charges exerts a diagonal force on the 1.0 nC charge. These forces are equal in magnitude because the charges and distances are symmetric. However, we need to calculate the vertical component of these forces, as the horizontal components cancel out.\n\n**Step 1.1: Calculate the total distance between a 2.0 nC charge and the 1.0 nC charge**\nThe 2.0 nC charge is at a horizontal distance $d_h = 3.0\\ cm=0.03\\ m$ and a vertical distance $d_v = 2.0\\ cm = 0.02\\ m$ from the 1.0 nC charge. The total distance (hypotenuse) is:\n$r_{side}=\\sqrt{d_h^{2}+d_v^{2}}=\\sqrt{(0.03)^{2}+(0.02)^{2}} = 0.036\\ m$\n\n**Step 1.2: Calculate the total force from one 2.0 nC charge**\nUsing Coulomb's Law:\n$F_{side}=k_e\\frac{q_1q_2}{r_{side}^{2}}$\nwhere:\n- $q_1 = 1.0\\ nC=1.0\\times 10^{-9}\\ C$\n- $q_2 = 2.0\\ nC=2.0\\times 10^{-9}\\ C$\n- $k_e = 8.99\\times 10^{9}\\ N\\cdot m^{2}\/C^{2}$\n- $r_{side}=0.036\\ m$\n$F_{side}=\\frac{8.99\\times 10^{9}(1.0\\times 10^{-9})(2.0\\times 10^{-9})}{(0.036)^{2}}=1.385\\times 10^{-5}\\ N$\n\n**Step 1.3: Calculate the vertical component of the force**\nThe vertical component is:\n$F_{vertical}=F_{side}\\sin\\theta$\nwhere:\n$\\sin\\theta=\\frac{d_v}{r_{side}}=\\frac{0.02}{0.036}=0.555$\nSo:\n$F_{vertical}=1.385\\times 10^{-5}\\times0.555 = 7.69\\times 10^{-6}\\ N$\nSince there are two 2.0 nC charges, the total upward force from them is:\n$F_{up}=2\\cdot F_{vertical}=2\\cdot7.69\\times 10^{-6}=1.538\\times 10^{-5}\\ N$\n\n**Explanation**:\nThus, we determined the vertical forces acting on the 1.0 nC charge due to the interaction with the two 2.0 nC charges. All these force summation gives a value of $1.538\\times 10^{-5}\\ N$ acting in the upward direction.\n\n**Step 2**\n**Force due to the charge q**\nThe charge q is located directly above the 1.0 nC charge at a distance $r_q = 4.0\\ cm=0.04\\ m$. Its force must balance the total upward force from Part 1.\n\n**Step 2.1: Use Coulomb's Law to find $F_q$**\nThe force exerted by q on the 1.0 nC charge is:\n$F_q=k_e\\frac{q_1q}{r_q^{2}}$\nRearranging for q:\n$q=\\frac{F_qr_q^{2}}{k_eq_1}$\nHere, $F_q = F_{up}=1.538\\times 10^{-5}\\ N$. Substituting the values:\n$q=\\frac{(1.538\\times 10^{-5})(0.04)^{2}}{(8.99\\times 10^{9})(1.0\\times 10^{-9})}$\n$q = 2.73\\times 10^{-9}\\ C=2.73\\ nC$\n\n**Explanation**:\nFrom this analysis, we deduced that the force that q must impose on the object is equal in magnitude but in order to have zero net force on the 1.0 nC charge it must exert a force equal to the total of the upward - force which was estimated to be $1.538\\times 10^{-5}\\ N$. This condition allowed us to estimate q to be 2.73 nC.\n\n**Answer**\n**Final Answer**:\nThe charge $q = 2.73\\ nC$"

First, consider the parallel - resistance calculations:\n   - For the parallel combination of $3R$ and $3\\Omega$ (assuming $R = 2\\Omega$), the equivalent resistance $R_1$ is given by the formula $R_1=3R\\parallel3$. Using the parallel - resistance formula $R_{eq}=\\frac{R_1\\times R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$, we have $R_1=\\frac{3\\times2\\times3}{3\\times2 + 3}=\\frac{18}{9}=2\\Omega$.\n   - For the parallel combination of $R$ and $6\\Omega$ (with $R = 2\\Omega$), the equivalent resistance $R_2$ is $R_2=R\\parallel6=\\frac{2\\times6}{2 + 6}=1.5\\Omega$.\n   - After reducing the circuit, the equivalent resistance across $AB$ is $R_{AB}(eqv)=2\\Omega\\parallel4\\Omega$. Using the parallel - resistance formula $R_{AB}(eqv)=\\frac{2\\times4}{2 + 4}=\\frac{8}{6}=\\frac{4}{3}\\Omega$.\n   - Explanation: When calculating the equivalent resistance, the voltage source is short - circuited and the current source is open - circuited.\n\n**Step 2**\n(B)\nLet $I_{3R}$ be the current passing through resistance $3R$. By the current - division rule in a parallel circuit, $I_{3R}=\\frac{3}{3 + 3R}\\times I'$, where $I'$ is the current passing in resistance $4\\Omega$. Given $R = 2\\Omega$ and $I' = 1.5A$, we have $I_{3R}=\\frac{3}{3+3\\times2}\\times1.5=\\frac{3}{9}\\times1.5 = 0.5A$.\n(C)\nLet $V_{AB}$ be the potential difference between $A$ and $B$. The potential difference $V_{AB}=3R\\times I_{3R}$. Substituting $R = 2\\Omega$ and $I_{3R}=0.5A$, we get $V_{AB}=3\\times2\\times0.5 = 3V$.\n(D)\nThe battery voltage $E = 4\\times I'+V_{AB}$. Substituting $I' = 1.5A$ and $V_{AB}=3V$, we have $E=4\\times1.5+3=9V$.\n(E)\nLet the total current be $I$. $I=\\frac{E}{2}+\\frac{E}{6}+I'$. Substituting $E = 9V$ and $I' = 1.5A$, we get $I=\\frac{9}{2}+\\frac{9}{6}+1.5=4.5 + 1.5+1.5=7.5A$.\nThe total power supplied by the battery is $P=E\\times I$. Substituting $E = 9V$ and $I = 7.5A$, we have $P=9\\times7.5 = 67.5W$.\n\n**Answer**\n(a) Equivalent resistance $R_{AB}(eqv)$: $R_{AB}(eqv)=\\frac{4}{3}\\Omega$\n(b) Let $I_{3R}$ current passing through resistance $3R$: $I_{3R}=0.5A$\n(c) Let $V_{AB}$ be the potential difference between $A$ and $B$: $V_{AB}=3V$\n(d) Battery voltage $E$: $E = 9V$\n(e) Total power supply battery is $P$: $P = 67.5Watt$\n![](images\/146459442_1b2db6afd2431ada08ffbb9d3f2a6c9e5999ff1dd36142ff2dce604f3e6de626.jpg)"

    "parsing":"**Step 1**\n- Acceleration tells how fast an object speeds up or slows down. It actually measures the rate of change in an object's velocity (which is the speed and direction combined).\n- If an object accelerates, it either changes its speed or direction.

A slope upwards means speeding up, downwards means slowing down and on the other hand straight line indicates constant speed. Steeper slopes represent faster changes in speed.\n\n**Step 2**\nOn velocity time graph at any point of time the acceleration can be simply obtained by knowing the slope of the tangent drawn at that specific point.\nNow at $t = 55.0s$, Let $a=$ acceleration = Slope of the tangent drawn to the graph at $t = 55.0s$\n$a=\\frac{v - u}{t}$\n$a=\\frac{1.0\\frac{m}{s}-6.0\\frac{m}{s}}{60.0s - 50.0s}$\n$a=\\frac{- 5.0\\frac{m}{s}}{10.0s}$\n$a=-0.5\\frac{m}{s^{2}}$\n(Here negative sign means that the direction of acceleration vector is towards west direction.)\nExplanation: Yes this represents the maximum magnitude of acceleration because the slope of velocity - time graph is steepest in time interval $(50.0s-60.0s)$.\n\n**Answer**\nAt $t = 55.0s$ acceleration is $-0.5\\frac{m}{s^{2}}$ and also this represent maximum magnitude of acceleration.\n(If you like the solution, Please support us by providing your one valuable upvote.)\nThank you so much for trusting us \ud83d\ude0a."

    "parsing":"**Solution**\n\n**Step 1**\nThe expression for electric field due to a line charge element is\n$$ \\vec{E}=\\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 l d}[(\\sin\\theta_2 - \\sin\\theta_1)\\hat{i}+(\\cos\\theta_2-\\cos\\theta_1)\\hat{j}] $$\nwhere $Q$ is the charge, $l$ is the length of the element, $d$ is the perpendicular distance from the line charge to the point. $\\theta_1,\\theta_2$ are the angles made by the point on the line charge.\n\nNow, in this problem, we need to find the angles $\\theta_1,\\theta_2$ and the perpendicular distance $d$ to the point $P$.\n\nFrom the figure, we can obtain:\n$$ a^{2}=(\\frac{a}{2})^{2}+h^{2} $$\n$$ h^{2}=a^{2}-(\\frac{a}{2})^{2} $$\n$$ h^{2}=\\frac{3a^{2}}{4} $$\n$$ h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}a}{2} $$\n\n**Explanation**:\nSince all the side are of same length, each side will represent an equilateral triangle of side $a$. Therefore, the angle between any two adjacent side will be $60^{\\circ}$\n\n**Step 2**\nNow, we have to take projection of the distance $d$ on the $xz$ - plane, so from the second figure we get the perpendicular distance\n$$ d=\\sqrt{h^{2}-(\\frac{a}{2})^{2}} $$\n$$ =\\sqrt{\\frac{3a^{2}}{4}-\\frac{a^{2}}{4}} $$\n$$ =\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n\nIf we take the projection of the angle we will get the value of $\\theta_1 = 0^{\\circ},\\theta_2=30^{\\circ}$\nThe charge on each side is $Q = Q'a$\nSo, the electric field due to one side at the point $P$ is\n$$ \\vec{E}=\\frac{Q'a}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 a(\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}})}[(\\sin\\theta_2 - \\sin\\theta_1)\\hat{i}+(\\cos\\theta_2-\\cos\\theta_1)\\hat{j}] $$\n\nNow, if we consider all four sides, then due to symmetry the $\\hat{i}$ component of electric field will cancel out.

Rod $AB$ has a diameter of 10mm, and $BC$ has a diameter of 8mm. The objective is to determine the forces acting on both rods.\n\n**Step 2**\n**SOLUTION**\n**Vertical Direction**:\nUsing the equilibrium condition for the vertical forces, the sum of forces must be equal to the weight of the lamp:\n\nSubstitute ($W = 784.8$N) and ($\\sin(60^{\\circ})=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}=0.866$):\n$T_{AB}\\times0.866 + T_{BC}\\times0.866=784.8$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n$0.866(T_{AB}+T_{BC}) = 784.8$\n\n$T_{AB}+T_{BC}=\\frac{784.8}{0.866}=906.93$N (Equation 1)\n\n**Horizontal Direction**:\nNow, consider the horizontal forces.

    "question":"### Paragraph for Questions 13 and 14\nThe top is particularly important example of the conservation of angular momentum, because it exemplifies the behaviour of any spinning object in a force - field. As such it has important application to the discussion of rotating atomic and nuclear particles. Consider a top of mass $m$ which, when viewed, is spinning in a counter - clockwise direction with angular momentum $\\vec{L}$. By convention, this is indicated by a vector length $\\vec{L}$ that points outward along the axis OA of the top as shown in figure - 1.\nIf the top is not upright, then the weight force $mg$ vertically down will provide a torque $\\vec{\\tau}$ about point O in the base of the top, which must tend to produce an increase in angular momentum in the direction of that torque. This direction will always be perpendicular to the direction of $\\vec{L}$; hence this torque can never change the magnitude of $\\vec{L}$, but only it direction. It is seen that $\\vec{L}$, and hence the axis of the top, will precess around in a circle about the vertical line $z$ - axis. \n(a) the centre of mass of the top is seen to be at a distance $r$ from the vertical. Consequently the torque is of magnitude: $\\tau=mgr$ This is, then, the magnitude of the rate of change of angular momentum $\\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt}$.\n(b) the angular momentum is depicted as precessing about the vertical with angular velocity $\\omega'=\\frac{d\\varphi}{dt}=\\frac{\\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt}\\sin\\theta}{L\\sin\\theta}=\\frac{\\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt}}{L}=\\frac{mgr}{L}=\\frac{mgh}{L}=\\frac{mgh}{I\\omega}$, where $h$ is the distance from the centre of mass to the base of the top, and $r = h\\sin\\theta$.\nFor the top shown, is made of ring of mass $m$ radius $R$ with three identical rods each of mass $m$ and length $R$ as shown in figure - 3.

    "parsing":"Step 1\n\nExplanation:\nCalculate Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of transmission peak for light interference through dielectric slab, we'll go through a series of steps.\n\nKey Concepts\n1. Interference in Thin Films: Transmission and reflection of light through a thin dielectric slab exhibit interference due to multiple reflections. Transmission is a result of the constructive and destructive interference of the light waves.\n2. Transmission Peaks: Position of transmission peaks is most sensitive to wavelength. Thickness of slab and refractive index are crucial parameters.\n3. FWHM Calculation: FWHM can be approximated using relationship between thickness of film, refractive index, and transmission coefficients.\n\nGiven Data\nRefractive index ($n = 1.5$)\nThickness ($t=211\\ nm$)\nReflectance ($r = 0.95$)\n\nStep 2\n\nSteps to Calculate FWHM\n1.

    "parsing":"Step 1\n Introduction\/Overview of the Question\nYou are given a circuit consisting of multiple resistors with different values. The task is to:\n1. Determine the equivalent resistance of the entire circuit.\n2. Calculate the current flowing through the circuit.\n3. Find the voltage drop across each resistor in the circuit.\n\nThe components are:\n- A 100\u03a9 resistor,\n- A 50\u03a9 resistor,\n- A 75\u03a9 resistor,\n- A 50\u03a9 resistor,\n- A 25\u03a9 resistor.\n\nYou are given a 90V power supply for the circuit.\n\nThe resistors are configured in a combination of series and parallel arrangements, so the solution requires the series and parallel resistance circuit analysis rules for resistors arranged in resistors.\n\nExplanation:\nThe circuit consists of a combination of resistors arranged in series and parallel combinations. The goal is to calculate the total voltage drop of the circuit, the current flowing through it, and the voltage drop across each resistor.\n\nStep 2\n Detailed Solution\n2.1: Finding the Equivalent Resistance of the Circuit\nWe can simplify the circuit step - by - step by combining resistors in series and parallel.\nFirst Combination: Resistors 50\u03a9 and 75\u03a9 in Parallel\n- The first two resistors (50\u03a9 and 75\u03a9) are in parallel. The formula for resistors in parallel is:\n$\\frac{1}{R_{eq1}}=\\frac{1}{R_1}+\\frac{1}{R_2}$\nSubstitute the values for $(R_1 = 50\\Omega)$ and $(R_2 = 75\\Omega)$:\n$\\frac{1}{R_{eq1}}=\\frac{1}{50}+\\frac{1}{75}$\nFind the least common denominator and simplify:\n$\\frac{1}{R_{eq1}}=\\frac{3 + 2}{150}=\\frac{5}{150}$\nNow calculate the value of $R_{eq1}$:\n$R_{eq1}=\\frac{150}{5}=30\\Omega$\n\nSecond Combination: Combine 30\u03a9 and 25\u03a9 Resistors in Series\nNow we have the 30\u03a9 combination from the previous step and the 25\u03a9 resistor in series. The equivalent resistance of resistors in series is the sum of their individual resistances:\n$R_{eq2}=30\\Omega+25\\Omega = 55\\Omega$\n\nThird Combination: Combine the 55\u03a9 and 100\u03a9 Resistors in Parallel\nNext, the 55\u03a9 combination is in parallel with the 100\u03a9 resistor. Use the parallel formula again:\n$\\frac{1}{R_{eq3}}=\\frac{1}{R_{eq2}}+\\frac{1}{R_3}$\nwhere $R_{eq2} = 55\\Omega$ and $R_3 = 100\\Omega$\n$\\frac{1}{R_{eq3}}=\\frac{1}{55}+\\frac{1}{100}$\nFind the least common denominator and simplify:\n$\\frac{1}{R_{eq3}}=\\frac{20 + 11}{1100}=\\frac{31}{1100}$\nNow calculate the value of $R_{eq3}$:\n$R_{eq3}=\\frac{1100}{31}\\approx35.48\\Omega$\n\nFinal Combination: Combine 35.48\u03a9 with 100\u03a9 in Series\nFinally, the 35.48\u03a9 combination is in series with the top 100\u03a9 resistor:\n$R_{eq}=35.48\\Omega+100\\Omega = 135.48\\Omega$\n\nSo, the equivalent resistance of the entire circuit is approximately 135.48\u03a9.\n\n2.2: Finding the Current Through the Circuit\nNow, we use Ohm's Law to calculate the current through the circuit:\n$I=\\frac{V}{R_{eq}}$\nSubstitute the known values:\n$I=\\frac{90V}{135.48\\Omega}\\approx0.665A$\n\nSo, the current through the circuit is approximately 0.665A.\n\n2.3: Voltage Drop Across Each Resistor\nNext, let's calculate the voltage drop across each resistor using Ohm's Law $(V = IR)$.\n\nVoltage Drop Across the 100\u03a9 Resistor (Top Resistor)\nThe total current flowing through the circuit is 0.665A. A voltage drop across the 100\u03a9 resistor is:\n$V_{100}=I\\times R = 0.665A\\times100\\Omega = 66.5V$\nSo, the voltage drop across the 100\u03a9 resistor is 66.5V.\n\nVoltage Drop Across the 30\u03a9 Combination (Parallel Resistors)\nThe total voltage across the parallel branch of 50\u03a9 and 75\u03a9 resistors is the same as the voltage drop across the combination, which is the difference between the total voltage (90V) and the voltage drop across the 100\u03a9 resistor:\n$V_{30}=V_{total}-V_{100}=90V - 66.5V=23.5V$\nNow, use this voltage to calculate the current through the 30\u03a9 (50 - 75 combination) of resistors:\n$I_{30}=\\frac{V_{30}}{R_{30}}=\\frac{23.5V}{30\\Omega}=0.783A$\nNow, calculate the voltage drop across the individual resistors in this parallel combination:\n- Voltage drop across the 50\u03a9 resistor:\n$V_{50}=I_{30}\\times50\\Omega = 0.783A\\times50\\Omega = 39.15V$\n- Voltage drop across the 75\u03a9 resistor:\n$V_{75}=I_{30}\\times75\\Omega = 0.783A\\times75\\Omega = 58.725V$\n\nVoltage Drop Across the 25\u03a9 Resistor\nThe current through the 25\u03a9 resistor is the same as the current through the 30\u03a9 combination, which is 0.783A. Therefore, the voltage drop across the 25\u03a9 resistor is:\n$V_{25}=I_{30}\\times25\\Omega = 0.783A\\times25\\Omega = 19.575V$\n\nExplanation:\n2.1: Finding the Equivalent Resistance of the Circuit\nFirst, we identify resistors that are in parallel and those in series, and reduce them step - by - step to find the equivalent resistance of the circuit.\n2.2: Finding the Current Through the Circuit\nOnce we have the equivalent resistance, we apply Ohm's Law to calculate the total current flowing through the circuit.\n2.3: Finding the Voltage Drop Across Each Resistor\nFinally, we calculate the voltage drop across each individual resistor by applying Ohm's Law for each one.\n\nAnswer\n Final Answer ...\n- Equivalent resistance of the circuit: 135.48\u03a9\n- Current through the circuit: 0.665A\n- Voltage drop across each resistor:\n  - Voltage drop across the 100\u03a9 resistor: 66.5V\n  - Voltage drop across the 50\u03a9 resistor (in parallel) : 39.15V\n  - Voltage drop across the 75\u03a9 resistor (in parallel) : 58.725V\n  - Voltage drop across the 25\u03a9 resistor: 19.575V"

    "parsing":"Step 1\nGiven\nThe resistive circuit contains the following components and values:\nVoltage source: ($\\epsilon = 12V$)\nResistors: ($R_1 = 7\\Omega$), ($R_2 = 4\\Omega$), and ($R_3 = 10\\Omega$)\nThe circuit also includes a switch that is initially open (part a)) and then closed (part b)).\nThe objective is to calculate the current through all resistors and the voltage drops ($\\Delta V_{ab}$), ($\\Delta V_{ac}$), and ($\\Delta V_{bc}$) when the switch is open and closed.\n\nExplanation:\nThe problem involves a resistive circuit with a voltage source and resistors. The objective is to calculate current through each resistor and the voltage drops across various points with an open and closed switch.\n\nStep 2\nsolution\nWhen the switch is open, the circuit on the right (connected to ($R_3$)) is disconnected.\nThus, the resistors ($R_1$) and ($R_2$) are in series, and the current flows only through these two resistors.\n1. Total resistance ($R_{total}=R_1 + R_2=7\\Omega+4\\Omega = 11\\Omega$)\n2. Current through the resistors using Ohm's law:\n$I=\\frac{\\epsilon}{R_{total}}$\n$=\\frac{12V}{11\\Omega}$\n$= 1.09A$\n\nTherefore, the current through ($R_1$) and ($R_2$) is (1.09 A).\nVoltage Drops:\nThe voltage - drop across ($R_1$) is:\n$\\Delta V_{R_1}=I\\times R_1$\n$=1.09A\\times7\\Omega$\n$=7.63V$\n\nThe voltage - drop across ($R_2$) is:\n$\\Delta V_{R_2}=I\\times R_2$\n$=1.09A\\times4\\Omega$\n$=4.36V$\n\nSince ($R_3$) is not in the circuit, the voltage drop across it is zero.\nThus, the voltage drops are:\n($\\Delta V_{ab}=7.63V$)\n($\\Delta V_{ac}=12V$) (since there is no current flowing through ($R_3$), the voltage is dropped across ($R_1$) and ($R_2$)).\n($\\Delta V_{bc}=4.36V$)\n\nWhen the switch is closed (part b)\nWhen the switch is closed, ($R_3$) is added to the circuit in parallel with ($R_2$). The equivalent resistance of ($R_2$) and ($R_3$) in parallel is calculated using the formula for parallel resistances:\n$\\frac{1}{R_{eq}}=\\frac{1}{R_2}+\\frac{1}{R_3}$\n$=\\frac{1}{4\\Omega}+\\frac{1}{10\\Omega}$\n$=\\frac{5}{20}+\\frac{2}{20}$\n$=\\frac{7}{20}$\n\n$R_{eq}=\\frac{20}{7}\\Omega$\n$=2.86\\Omega$\n\n### Total Resistance:\nNow, the total resistance of the circuit, which includes ($R_1$) and the parallel combination of ($R_2$) and ($R_3$), is:\n$R_{total}=R_1 + R_{eq}$\n$=7\\Omega+2.86\\Omega$\n$=9.86\\Omega$\n\nCurrent Calculation:\nUsing Ohm's law, the total current is:\n$I=\\frac{\\epsilon}{R_{total}}$\n$=\\frac{12V}{9.86\\Omega}$\n$=1.22A$\n\nVoltage Drops:\nThe voltage - drop across ($R_1$) is:\n$\\Delta V_{R_1}=I\\times R_1$\n$=1.22A\\times7\\Omega$\n$=8.54V$\n\nThe voltage - drop across the equivalent parallel resistance ($R_{eq}$) is:\n$\\Delta V_{R_{eq}}=I\\times R_{eq}$\n$=1.22A\\times2.86\\Omega$\n$=3.49V$\n\nThus, the voltage drops are:\n($\\Delta V_{ab}=8.54V$)\n($\\Delta V_{ac}=12V$)\n($\\Delta V_{bc}=3.49V$)\n\nExplanation:\nWhen the switch is open, current flows through only two resistors in series. The equivalent resistance is calculated, and current and voltage drops across resistors are determined. When the switch is closed, a parallel resistor combination is added, reducing total resistance, which affects the current and voltage drops.\n\nAnswer\nPart A (Switch Open):\nCurrent: (1.09 A)\nVoltage drops: ($\\Delta V_{ab}=7.63V$), ($\\Delta V_{ac}=12V$), ($\\Delta V_{bc}=4.36V$)\nPart B (Switch Closed):\nCurrent: (1.22 A)\nVoltage drops: ($\\Delta V_{ab}=8.54V$), ($\\Delta V_{ac}=12V$), ($\\Delta V_{bc}=3.49V$)"

The image description tells us that:\n$V_{S1}=- 1.5kV$\n$V_{S2}=200V$\n$R_{1}=2.2M\\Omega$\n$R_{2}=3.3M\\Omega$\n$R_{3}=4.7M\\Omega$\n$R_{4}=680k\\Omega$\n$R_{5}=1.5M\\Omega$\n$R_{6}=560k\\Omega$\n$R_{7}=1.2M\\Omega$\n$R_{8}=220k\\Omega$\n\n**Step 4**\nPlugging in these values, we get:\n$V_{AB}=\\frac{-1.5\\times10^{3}\\cdot(4.7\\times10^{6}+220\\times10^{3}) + 200\\cdot(2.2\\times10^{6}+3.3\\times10^{6}+220\\times10^{3})+V_{AD}\\cdot(2.2\\times10^{6}+3.3\\times10^{6}+4.7\\times10^{6})}{2.2\\times10^{6}+3.3\\times10^{6}+4.7\\times10^{6}+220\\times10^{3}}$\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n$V_{AB}=-0.001\\cdot V_{AD}+0.0002$\nWe can use this equation to find $V_{AD}$ by plugging in different values of $V_{AB}$ and solving for $V_{AD}$. For example, if we assume that $V_{AB}$ is zero, then we get:\n$0=-0.001\\cdot V_{AD}+0.0002$\nSolving for $V_{AD}$, we get:\n$V_{AD}=0.2V$\nThis means that the voltage - difference between the nodes A and D is $0.2V$. We can check this answer by plugging it back into the equation and verifying that it satisfies the equation.\n\n**Step 5**\nExplanation:\nTo give the color - code for all the resistors, we need to use the resistor color - code chart from the web search results. The chart tells us that each color represents a digit or a multiplier or a tolerance. The first two or three colors represent the significant digits of the resistance value in ohms. The next color represents the multiplier, which shifts the decimal point to the right or left. The last color represents the tolerance, which is the margin of error of the resistance value.\nUsing this chart, we can give the color - code for each resistor as follows:\n$R_{1}=2.2M\\Omega$: Red - Red - Green - Gold\n$R_{2}=3.3M\\Omega$: Orange - Orange - Green - Gold\n$R_{3}=4.7M\\Omega$: Yellow - Purple - Green - Gold\n$R_{4}=680k\\Omega$: Blue - Gray - Yellow - Gold\n$R_{5}=1.5M\\Omega$: Brown - Green - Green - Gold\n$R_{6}=560k\\Omega$: Green - Blue - Yellow - Gold\n$R_{7}=1.2M\\Omega$: Brown - Red - Green - Gold\n$R_{8}=220k\\Omega$: Brown - Red - Orange - Gold\n\n**Answer**\nThis was about Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL) to the loop that contains the nodes A and D and the color - code for all the resistors."

    "parsing":"1. **Step 1: Calculate the radius $r$ and trigonometric - functions of the angle $\\theta$**\n   - The radius of the circular - path of the ball of mass $m = 1.09\\ kg$ rotating in the horizontal circle is given by:\n     - $r=\\sqrt{L^{2}-\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^{2}}$, where $L = 1.94\\ m$ and $d = 1.94\\ m$.\n     - $r=\\sqrt{(1.94)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{1.94}{2}\\right)^{2}}=\\sqrt{(1.94)^{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)}=\\sqrt{(1.94)^{2}\\times\\frac{3}{4}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{(1.94)^{2}\\times3}{4}} = 1.68\\ m$.\n     - The angle $\\theta$ of each string with the horizontal is calculated as follows:\n       - $\\sin\\theta=\\frac{\\frac{d}{2}}{L}=\\frac{\\frac{1.94}{2}}{1.94}=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n       - $\\cos\\theta=\\frac{r}{L}=\\frac{1.68}{1.94}=0.866$.\n2. **Step 2: Find the tension in the lower string $T_2$**\n   - In vertical equilibrium, $T_{1y}=T_{2y}+mg$, where $T_{1y}=T_1\\sin\\theta$, $T_{2y}=T_2\\sin\\theta$, $T_1 = 45.0\\ N$, $m = 1.09\\ kg$, and $g = 9.8\\ m\/s^{2}$.\n   - $T_1\\sin\\theta=T_2\\sin\\theta+mg$.\n   - Substitute the values: $45.0\\times\\frac{1}{2}=T_2\\times\\frac{1}{2}+(1.09\\times9.8)$.\n   - $\\frac{T_2}{2}=(22.5 - 10.682)\\ N$.\n   - $T_2=(11.818\\times2)\\ N = 23.636\\ N\\approx23.6\\ N$.\n3. **Step 3: Analyze the net - force acting on the ball**\n   - Since the ball is rotating in a stable circular path, the magnitude of the net - force acting on the ball is zero, $F_{net}=0$.\n   - The object is rotating with a constant speed because the tensions in the strings are constant with time. For horizontal equilibrium, the net horizontal force acting on the ball is zero, and for vertical equilibrium, the net vertical force acting on the ball is zero.\n4. **Step 4: Calculate the speed $v$ of the ball**\n   - In horizontal equilibrium, $T_{1x}+T_{2x}=F_r$, where $T_{1x}=T_1\\cos\\theta$, $T_{2x}=T_2\\cos\\theta$, and $F_r=\\frac{mv^{2}}{r}$.\n   - $T_1\\cos\\theta+T_2\\cos\\theta=\\frac{mv^{2}}{r}$.\n   - Substitute $T_1 = 45.0\\ N$, $T_2 = 23.636\\ N$, $m = 1.09\\ kg$, $r = 1.68\\ m$, and $\\cos\\theta = 0.866$:\n     - $(45.0\\times0.866)+(23.636\\times0.866)=\\frac{1.09v^{2}}{1.68}$.\n     - $(45.0 + 23.636)\\times0.866=\\frac{1.09v^{2}}{1.68}$.\n     - $68.636\\times0.866=\\frac{1.09v^{2}}{1.68}$.\n     - $59.44=\\frac{1.09v^{2}}{1.68}$.\n     - $v=\\sqrt{\\frac{59.44\\times1.68}{1.09}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{99.86}{1.09}}=9.57\\ m\/s$.\n\n**Answer**:\na) The tension in the lower string is $23.6\\ N$.\nb) The magnitude of the net force acting on the ball is zero.\nc) The speed of the ball in the circular path is $9.57\\ m\/s$.\n![](images\/146052558_e762d9f79f9dd520ce4b904d824e3f4aabce4b8c7ccbe7e817349b52326616f2.jpg)"

The electric field direction is always perpendicular to the equipotential lines and points from higher potential to lower potential. At point B, the equipotential lines indicate the field points downward (from 8 V to 6 V). Therefore, the electric force on the proton at point B points downward. A proton experiences a force in the direction of the electric field because it is positively charged.\n\nStep 3\n\nExplanation:\nCalculation of the magnitude of electric field at D\nc. The electric field magnitude can be estimated using the formula\n$E=\\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta x}$\nwhere, $\\Delta V$ is the potential difference between two equipotential lines and $\\Delta x$ is the distance between those lines.\nAt point D\n$\\Delta V = 1V$(difference between adjacent equipotential lines),\n$\\Delta x = 1cm=0.01m$\n$E=\\frac{1V}{0.01m}=100, V\/m$\nThus, the magnitude of the electric field at point D is approximately 100V\/m.\nThis calculation follows the relation $E = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta x}$, using the given equipotential spacing.\n\nAnswer\nTherefore, the answer of all the parts had been determined."

    "answer":"A",
    "parsing":"Step 1\n Introduction\/Overview of the Question\nThe problem involves finding the resultant force and its direction for a 2D concurrent force system using the law of sines and cosines. There are two forces:\n1. Force 1(70N): Directed to the left at an angle of 100\u00b0 from the positive x - axis.\n2. Force 2(36N): Directed at 56\u00b0 from the positive x - axis.\n\nOur goal is to:\n- Calculate the resultant force magnitude and its direction using vector addition and trigonometry.\n- Verify the results using the component method.\n- Present a graph of the forces and resultant vector.\n\nExplanation:\nThe problem involves determining the combined effect of two forces acting at an angle to each other. We aim to find the overall force (resultant) and its direction using trigonometric principles and verify the result graphically.\n\nStep 2\n Solving Using Trigonometry (Law of Sines and Cosines)\nWe use the law of cosines to find the magnitude of the resultant vector (R):\n$$ R=\\sqrt{F_1^{2}+F_2^{2}-2F_1F_2\\cos(\\theta)} $$\nwhere:\n- $(F_1 = 70,N)$\n- $(F_2 = 36,N)$\n- $(\\theta=180^{\\circ}-(100^{\\circ}-56^{\\circ}) = 136^{\\circ})$\n\nTo find the direction of (R), we use the law of sines:\n$$ \\frac{\\sin(\\alpha)}{F_2}=\\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{R} $$\nwhere $(\\alpha)$ is the angle between $(R)$ and $(F_1)$.\n\nVector Representation of Forces and Resultant\n\nExplanation:\nUsing trigonometric rules, the resultant force is calculated by combining the two given forces and accounting for their angle of separation. This involves determining both the magnitude and direction of the resultant force.\n\nStep 3\n Results and Graph\nFrom the calculations and plotted graph:\n- Resultant Force Magnitude: $(R = 99.10,N)$\n- Direction of Resultant Force: $(85.38^{\\circ}$ from the positive x - axis$)$\n\nThe graph visualizes:\n- $F_1(70N)$ in blue, pointing at $100^{\\circ}$ from the x - axis.\n- $F_2(36N)$ in red, pointing at $56^{\\circ}$ from the x - axis.\n- Resultant vector $(R)$ in green, combining the two forces.\n\nExplanation:\nThe forces and their resultant are plotted on a graph to visualize their directions and magnitudes. The graph confirms the calculated values by showing how the two forces combine.\n\nAnswer\n Final Answer..\nThe resultant force of the system is approximately 99.10 N at an angle of 85.38\u00b0 from the positive x - axis. The calculations using the law of sines and cosines were verified visually using the graph, ensuring accuracy.\n![](images\/73eea6455399a2045ded46f26ddcfa78d4adb505e01625da578db6be0f791169.jpg)"

    "parsing":"### Solution\n\n#### Step 1\nConsider the following:\n\nThere is a 1.96 - mol sample of an ideal monoatomic gas that changes states isothermally.\nThe process starts at a temperature of $(T_{i}=404K)$, and the change in entropy $(\\Delta S)$ is plotted on the horizontal axis with a scale of $21.8\\frac{J}{K}$.\n\nWhat is the objective of this question? From this question, it follows:\n(a) What is the energy supplied to the gas as heat?\n(b) What is the change of the gas internal energy?\n(c) What is the work done by the gas?\n\n**Explanation**:\nA 1.96 - mol sample of a monoatomic gas undergoes a reversible process. The problem asks to calculate the energy absorbed as heat, change in internal energy, and work done by the gas.\n\n#### Step 2\n**Solution Details**\n\n(a) **Energy Absorbed as Heat**\nThe heat energy absorbed by the gas can be calculated using the equation:\n$[Q = T\\Delta S]$\nWhere:\n- $(Q)$ is the heat absorbed (in joules).\n- $(T)$ is the initial temperature $(404K)$.\n- $(\\Delta S)$ is the change in entropy.\n\nFrom the graph, the change in entropy $(\\Delta S)$ is the horizontal difference between the initial and final entropy points. Given that the scale of $(\\Delta S)$ is $21.8\\frac{J}{K}$, we can measure the change in $(\\Delta S)$ from the graph.\nAssume that the final entropy is $0\\frac{J}{K}$ based on the graph. Therefore, the change in entropy is $(\\Delta S = 21.8J\/K)$.\n\nNow, calculate $(Q)$:\n$[Q = 404K\\times21.8J\/K = 8817.2J=8.817kJ]$\n\n(b) **Change in Internal Energy of the Gas**\nFor an ideal monoatomic gas, the change in internal energy is related to the change in temperature. The formula for the change in internal energy is:\n$[\\Delta U=nC_{V}\\Delta T]$\nWhere:\n- $(n)$ is the number of moles ($1.96mol$).\n- $(C_{V})$ is the molar heat - capacity at constant volume for a monoatomic ideal gas, which is $(C_{V}=\\frac{3}{2}R)$, where $(R)$ is the gas constant $(8.314\\frac{J}{mol\\cdot K})$.\n- $(\\Delta T)$ is the change in temperature, which can be determined from the graph.\nFrom the graph, the initial temperature is $404K$, and assuming the final temperature is $0K$, we get $(\\Delta T = 404K)$.\n\nNow, calculate $(\\Delta U)$:\n$[C_{V}=\\frac{3}{2}\\times8.314J\/mol\\cdot K = 12.471J\/mol\\cdot K]$\n$[\\Delta U = 1.96mol\\times12.471J\/mol\\cdot K\\times404K = 9633.77J = 9.634kJ]$\n\n(c) **Work Done by the Gas**\nThe work done by the gas during a reversible process can be calculated as:\n$[W = Q-\\Delta U]$\nWhere:\n- $(Q)$ is the heat absorbed $(8.817kJ)$.\n- $(\\Delta U)$ is the change in internal energy $(9.634kJ)$.\n\nNow, calculate $(W)$:\n$[W = 8.817kJ - 9.634kJ=- 0.817kJ]$\nThis negative value indicates that the gas does work on the surroundings.\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe quantity of energy absorbed as heat is calculated from the initial and final temperature and entropy change. The change in internal energy involves a set of calculations where the heat capacity and the temperature difference are primary parameters. Work done by the gas is the quantity of the internal energy change subtracted from the heat absorbed.\n\n### Answer\n**Final Answers**\n- (a) The energy absorbed as heat by the gas is $8.817kJ$.\n- (b) The change in the internal energy of the gas is $9.634kJ$.\n- (c) The work done by the gas is $-0.817kJ$."

    "answer":"C",
    "parsing":"Step 1\n1: Conceptual Basic introduction\nMy question asks to analyze a static scenario where a bear is sitting on a beam supported by a hinge and a cable. Understanding static equilibrium is very important because it ensures that the sum of the forces and moments acting on the system is zero. This concept is fundamental in mechanics and allows structures to be stable and reactions to be determined.\n\nExplanation:\nStatic equilibrium is essential to analyze structures that are not in motion. In this scenario, the beam, bearing and cable system are operating under equilibrium conditions. Therefore, we need to make the sum of the vertical and horizontal forces zero and also make the sum of the moments about any point zero. In this way, we can calculate the unknown forces such as tension and reaction forces at the hinge in mechanics.\n\n2: Presentation of Related Formulas\nFormulas\n1. Total of Vertical Forces:\n$$ \\sum F_y = 0 \\Rightarrow R_y+T\\cdot\\sin(\\theta)=W_b + W_k+W_f $$\n2. Total of Horizontal Forces:\n$$ \\sum F_x = 0 \\Rightarrow R_x=T\\cdot\\cos(\\theta) $$\n3. Total of Moments around the Hinge:\n$$ \\sum M = 0 \\Rightarrow T\\cdot L\\cdot\\cos(\\theta)=W_b\\cdot x + W_k\\cdot\\frac{L}{2}+W_f\\cdot L $$\n\nExplanation:\nThese formulas are derived from static equilibrium conditions. The sum of vertical and horizontal forces ensures that the system remains at rest in any direction. The moment equation provides rotational equilibrium around any point. These equations are needed to solve the unknowns; reaction forces at the hinge and tension forces at the cable etc.\n\n3: Detailed Step-by-Step Solution\nStep 1: Calculate the Tension in the Cable\n1. Sum of moments about the hinge:\n$$ T\\cdot6\\cdot\\cos(60^{\\circ})=700\\cdot1 + 200\\cdot3+80\\cdot6 $$\n$$ 3T = 700 + 600+480 $$\n$$ 3T = 1,780 $$\n$$ T=\\frac{1780}{3}\\approx593.33\\ N $$\n\nExplanation:\nWe use the moment equation to solve for the tension (T) in the cable. By taking moments about the hinge, the contributions of the weights of the bear, beam, and loads balance the tension in the cable.\n\nStep 2\nStep 2: Reaction Forces at the Hinge Calculate\n1. Total of Vertical Forces:\n$$ R_y = 700 + 200+80 - 593.33\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} $$\n$$ R_y = 980 - 513.33 $$\n$$ R_y\\approx466.67\\ N $$\n2. Total of Horizontal Forces:\n$$ R_x = 593.33\\cdot0.5 $$\n$$ R_x\\approx296.67\\ N $$\n\nExplanation:\nThe vertical and horizontal force equations are used to solve for the reaction forces at the hinge. These forces maintain the beam in static equilibrium.\n\nStep 3\nStep 3: Determine the Maximum Distance (x) Before Cable Break\n1. Maximum Tension Moment Equation Recalculate:\n$$ 900\\cdot6\\cdot0.5 = 700\\cdot x+200\\cdot3 + 80\\cdot6 $$\n$$ 2,700 = 700x+600 + 480 $$\n$$ 700x = 2,700 - 1,080 $$\n$$ 700x = 1,620 $$\n$$ x=\\frac{1620}{700}\\approx2.31\\ m $$\n\nExplanation:\nThe maximum tension that the cable can withstand is used to find the maximum tension (x) Ay can walk before the cable breaks. This ensures that the system remains balanced without exceeding the tensile strength of the cable.\n\nAnswer\nResult\nAy can walk approximately 2.31 meters before the cable reaches its maximum tension and runs the risk of breaking. This solution maintains static balance by ensuring that all forces and moments are balanced."

The plot below represents typical potential energy $E$ as a function of the deformation parameter $dr$.

This value reflects the angle of bed deformation resulting from the cylinder extension process.\n\nResults\nBased on the analysis (using appropriate tools and assumptions), the calculated results are:\n- Initial Bed Angle: 35.54\u00b0\n- Final Bed Angle: 16.60\u00b0\n- Angular Displacement: - 18.94\u00b0\n- Consequently, the angle by which the truck bed was inclined with respect to the original position reduced by nearly 18.94 degrees with the help of the hydraulic cylinder extension.\n\nExplanation:\nConcept:\nLift is a pressure that opposed the direction of flow of the fluid and produces an outward force on an object such as the aircraft wing. This lift is mainly drawn from the pressure difference on the two surfaces of the wing where the pressure above the wing, due to faster moving air above the curved upper surface is higher than pressure down below the wing. This pressure difference, in fact, yields an upward force of gravity that helps in flight.\n\nAnswer\n\nFINAL ANSWER\nSo, realting angular displccement = - 18.94\u00b0"

For a sector with angle \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\), the moments of inertia about the \\\\(x\\\\)-axis and \\\\(y\\\\)-axis are:\\n\\\\[\\nI_{xx} = \\\\frac{m R^2}{2} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{4 \\\\sin^2(\\\\theta\/2)}{3\\\\theta}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{m R^2}{2} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{4 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{2}}{3\\\\cdot \\\\frac{3\\\\pi}{2}}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{m R^2}{2} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{4}{9\\\\pi}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{m R^2}{2} \\\\left(\\\\frac{9\\\\pi - 4}{9\\\\pi}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{18\\\\pi}\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\nI_{yy} = \\\\frac{m R^2}{2} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{4 \\\\sin^2(\\\\theta\/2)}{3\\\\theta}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{18\\\\pi}\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\nI_{zz} = I_{xx} + I_{yy} = \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{9\\\\pi}\\n\\\\]\\nSince the plate is symmetric about the z-axis, the product of inertia terms are zero:\\n\\\\[\\nJ_{xy} = J_{xz} = J_{yz} = 0\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThus, the inertia tensor matrix at point \\\\( O \\\\) is:\\n\\\\[\\n(I)_0 = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{18\\\\pi} & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{18\\\\pi} & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{9\\\\pi} \\\\end{bmatrix}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n### Step 3: Inertia Tensor Matrix \\\\((I)_G\\\\) at Point \\\\( G \\\\)\\n\\nUsing the parallel axis theorem, we shift the inertia tensor to the center of mass \\\\( G \\\\). The distance from \\\\( O \\\\) to \\\\( G \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\frac{2R\\\\sqrt{2}}{3\\\\pi} \\\\) along the \\\\( x \\\\)-axis. The parallel axis theorem gives:\\n\\\\[\\nI_{xx,G} = I_{xx,O} - m \\\\left( \\\\frac{2R\\\\sqrt{2}}{3\\\\pi} \\\\right)^2 = \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{18\\\\pi} - m \\\\left( \\\\frac{2R\\\\sqrt{2}}{3\\\\pi} \\\\right)^2 = \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{18\\\\pi} - m \\\\frac{8R^2}{9\\\\pi^2} = \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4) \\\\pi - 16R^2}{18\\\\pi^2}\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\nI_{yy,G} = I_{yy,O} + m \\\\left( \\\\frac{2R\\\\sqrt{2}}{3\\\\pi} \\\\right)^2 = \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{18\\\\pi} + m \\\\frac{8R^2}{9\\\\pi^2} = \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4) \\\\pi + 16R^2}{18\\\\pi^2}\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\nI_{zz,G} = I_{zz,O} = \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{9\\\\pi}\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\nJ_{xy,G} = J_{xz,G} = J_{yz,G} = 0\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThus, the inertia tensor matrix at point \\\\( G \\\\) is:\\n\\\\[\\n(I)_G = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4) \\\\pi - 16R^2}{18\\\\pi^2} & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4) \\\\pi + 16R^2}{18\\\\pi^2} & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{9\\\\pi} \\\\end{bmatrix}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n### Step 4: Inertia Tensor Matrix at Point \\\\( O \\\\), Referring to Its Main Axes of Inertia\\n\\nThe main axes of inertia at point \\\\( O \\\\) are the \\\\( x \\\\)-axis, \\\\( y \\\\)-axis, and \\\\( z \\\\)-axis, since the inertia tensor at \\\\( O \\\\) is already diagonal. Thus, the inertia tensor matrix at point \\\\( O \\\\) in its main axes is:\\n\\\\[\\n(I) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{18\\\\pi} & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{18\\\\pi} & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{9\\\\pi} \\\\end{bmatrix}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThus, the final answer is:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{18\\\\pi} & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{18\\\\pi} & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{9\\\\pi} \\\\end{bmatrix}}\\n\\\\]\n\nD.

    "answer":"A",
    "parsing":"**Step 1**\nHooke's Law describes the force exerted by a spring when it is compressed or extended:\n$F = -kx$\nwhere:\n- $F$ is the force exerted by the spring,\n- $k$ is the spring constant (a measure of the stiffness of the spring),\n- $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen a spring is at its rest length, the forces acting on it are balanced, and there is no net force. In this condition, the spring force is zero. The spring force (also known as the restoring force) depends on how much the spring is compressed or extended from its equilibrium position.\n\n**Step 2**\n**Part a) Resting System Analysis**\n**For mass $m_1$**:\n1. The tension $T_1$ in the rope is equal to the gravitational force on $m_1$ because the system is at rest.\n2. $T_1=m_1g$\n3. Calculated tension: $T_1 = 1.5\\ kg\\times9.81\\frac{m}{s^2}=14.715\\ N$\n\n**For mass $m_2$**:\n1. The tension $T_2$ in the rope is equal to the gravitational force on $m_2$.\n2. $T_2 = m_2g$\n3. Calculated tension: $T_2 = 2\\ kg\\times9.81\\frac{m}{s^2}=19.62\\ N$\n\n**Spring Compression\/Extension**:\n1. At rest, the spring is neither compressed nor extended, so $x = l_0$\n2. $F_{spring}=k(x - l_0)=0\\ N$\n\nExplanation:\nThe spring is at rest length, so there's no compression or extension, hence no force exerted by the spring.\n\n**Step 3**\n**Part b) Impact Analysis**\n**For mass $m_3$ dropping**:\n1. Using the equation of motion for free - fall to find velocity before impact:\n$v_{m3}^2 = 2gh\\Rightarrow v_{m3}=\\sqrt{2gh}$\n2. Calculated velocity before impact: $v_{m3}=\\sqrt{2\\times9.8\\times2}=6.26\\frac{m}{s}$\n\n**After impact**:\n1.

    "answer":"C",
    "parsing":"Here is the solution step by step:\n**For part (a):**\n1. Estimate the current: Since three identical bulbs are connected in series, the total resistance is three times the resistance of a single bulb. Looking at the graph in Figure 3, for a voltage of 1.5 V (which is the battery voltage), the current is around 40 mA. Therefore, the estimated total resistance is $\\frac{1.5V}{3\\times40mA}=12.5\\Omega$.\n**Explanation**:\nFor (a), estimate total resistance: Three bulbs in series, voltage 1.5V, current ~40mA, yields total resistance ~12.5$\\Omega$.\n\n**Step 2**\n1. Calculate the power: Using the formula $P = \\frac{V^{2}}{R}$, where P is power, V is voltage, and R is resistance, the total power draw from the battery is $\\frac{(1.5V)^{2}}{12.5}\\Omega = 0.18W$.\n**For part (b)**:\na. Estimate the current for each bulb: Since three identical bulbs are connected in parallel, the voltage across each bulb is the same as the battery voltage, which is 1.5 V. From the graph, the current for each bulb at 1.5 V is around 60 mA.\n**Explanation**:\nFor (b), each parallel bulb gets full 1.5V, graph shows ~60mA at this voltage, estimating current for each bulb.\n\n**Step 3**\n1. Calculate the total current: Since the bulbs are in parallel, the total current is the sum of the currents in each bulb. Therefore, the total current is $3\\times60mA = 180mA$.\n2. Calculate the power: Using the formula $P = V\\times I$, where I is current, the total power draw from the battery is $1.5V\\times180mA = 0.27W$.\n**Explanation**:\nTotal current: 3 bulbs in parallel give $3\\times60mA = 180mA$. Power: $P = V\\times I$, yielding 0.27 W.\n\n**Answer**\n**Conclusion**:\n- These are estimates because the exact values of current and resistance depend on the specific IV curve of the bulbs, which can vary slightly even for identical bulbs.\n- The assumption that the battery voltage remains constant is a simplification. In reality, the battery voltage would decrease slightly as the current increases."

    "parsing":"1. **Step 1 - Diagram and calculation of angles for maxima**:\n   - We start by making a diagram with a slit - like structure where $a = 11.8m$ is the width of the slit. The condition for maxima in a single - slit diffraction is $a\\sin\\theta=n\\lambda$.\n   - First, we calculate the wavelength $\\lambda=\\frac{c}{f}$, where $c = 3\\times10^{8}m\/s$ and $f = 87.4\\times10^{6}Hz$. So, $\\lambda=\\frac{3\\times10^{8}}{87.4\\times10^{6}}=3.432m$.\n   - For $n = 1$, $a\\sin\\theta_1=\\lambda$, then $\\sin\\theta_1=\\frac{\\lambda}{a}=\\frac{3.432}{11.8}$, and $\\theta_1=\\sin^{- 1}(\\frac{3.432}{11.8})\\approx16.911^{\\circ}$.\n   - For $n = 2$, $a\\sin\\theta_2 = 2\\lambda$, then $\\sin\\theta_2=\\frac{2\\lambda}{a}=\\frac{2\\times3.432}{11.8}$, and $\\theta_2=\\sin^{-1}(\\frac{2\\times3.432}{11.8})\\approx35.5757^{\\circ}$.\n   - The average angle $\\theta=\\frac{\\theta_1+\\theta_2}{2}=\\frac{16.911 + 35.5757}{2}=26.243^{\\circ}$.\n2. **Step 2 - Calculation of intensity at a given angle**:\n   - The intensity at a point $P$ in single - slit diffraction is given by $I'=I_0\\frac{\\sin^{2}\\alpha}{\\alpha^{2}}$, where $\\alpha=\\frac{\\pi a\\sin\\theta}{\\lambda}$.\n   - Substituting $a = 11.8m$, $\\lambda = 3.432m$, and $\\theta = 26.243^{\\circ}$ (in radians, $\\theta = 26.243\\times\\frac{\\pi}{180}$), we get $\\alpha=\\frac{3.14\\times11.8\\times\\sin(26.243^{\\circ})}{3.432}\\approx4.775$ radians.\n   - Then $I'=I_0\\frac{\\sin^{2}(4.775)}{4.775^{2}}$, and $I' = 0.0436I_0$.\n\n3. **Answer**:\n   - The ratio of the intensity $I'$ of the radio - signal at half the angular distance, as measured from the central axis, between the first and second minima to the intensity $I_0$ of the central maximum is $\\frac{I'}{I_0}=0.0436$.\n\nThe content with LaTeX expressions:\n\n**Step 1**\nLet us make the diagram.\nCondition for maxima: $a\\sin\\theta=n\\lambda$\n$n = 1\\Rightarrow a\\sin\\theta_1=\\lambda\\Rightarrow\\sin\\theta_1=\\frac{\\lambda}{a}$\n$n = 2\\Rightarrow a\\sin\\theta_2 = 2\\lambda\\Rightarrow\\sin\\theta_2=\\frac{2\\lambda}{a}$\n$\\lambda=\\frac{c}{f}=\\frac{3\\times10^{8}}{87.4\\times10^{6}} = 3.432m$\n$\\theta_1=\\sin^{-1}(\\frac{3.432}{11.8})$\n$\\theta_1 = 16.911^{\\circ}$\n$\\theta_2=\\sin^{-1}(\\frac{2\\times3.432}{11.8})$\n$\\theta_2 = 35.5757^{\\circ}$\nExplanation:\nTherefore we have $\\theta=\\frac{\\theta_1+\\theta_2}{2}=\\frac{16.911 + 35.5757}{2}=26.243^{\\circ}$\n\n**Step 2**\nInitially at point $P$\n$I'=I_0\\frac{\\sin^{2}\\alpha}{\\alpha^{2}}$ where $\\alpha=\\frac{\\pi a\\sin\\theta}{\\lambda}$\n$\\alpha=\\frac{3.14\\times11.8\\times\\sin(26.24^{\\circ})}{3.432}$\n$\\alpha = 4.775$ radians\ntherefore, $I'=I_0\\frac{\\sin^{2}(4.775)}{4.775^{2}}$\n$I' = 0.0436I_0$\nExplanation:\ntherefore we get $\\frac{I'}{I_0}=0.0436$\n\n**Answer**\nTherefore, the ratio of the intensity $I'$ of the radio - signal at half the angular distance, as measured from the central axis, between the first and second minima to the intensity $I_0$ of the central maximum $\\frac{I'}{I_0}=0.0436$\n![](images\/145914049_a6fbeb2da9257b02dae8131c438d8dded6535b2af75874fcfefbedc4d231854e.jpg)"

    "parsing":"### Solution\n\n#### Step 1: Conceptual Introduction\nElectric field is defined as force per unit positive charge that a point charge senses at some specific point or position in space. Electric field strength is force experienced per unit charge at a hypothetical test point charge would experience at some given point in space. Coulomb's law describes the electric field strength at a distance r as the force, experienced by a unit positive test charge which is placed at that point only. The magnitude of the electric field around a point charge q, at a distance r, in Coulomb's law point in space or electric field strength is the force experienced by a unit positive test charge placed at that point. The electric field magnitude at the distance r is described by Coulomb's Law: the force experienced by a unit positive test charge placed at that point. For a point charge q, the electric field magnitude at a distance r is given by Coulomb's Law:\n$$ E = \\frac{k|q|}{r^{2}} $$\nwhere $k$ is Coulomb's constant $k = 8.99\\times10^{9}\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C^{2}}$, $|q|$ is the magnitude of the charge, and r is the distance from the charge to the point of interest.\n\n#### Presentation of Relevant Formulas\n1. **Electric Field of a Point Charge**:\n$$ E=\\frac{k|q|}{r^{2}} $$\nThis formula indicates the magnitude of the electric field at a particular radius due to a point - charge or charges.\n2. **Vector Addition for Electric Fields**:\nThe net electric field at the point is the vector sum of individual electric field components:\n$$ E_{net}=\\sqrt{E_{x}^{2}+E_{y}^{2}} $$\n3. **Resolving Components**:\nBy applying trigonometric functions we can find the horizontal and the vertical component of the electric field from a charge.\n$$ E_{x}=E\\cos\\theta,E_{y}=E\\sin\\theta $$\n\n#### Explanation\nElectric - field is the electric force on a point charge having capability of providing a quantitative measure of electric field per unit positive point charge placed at that point. The electric field produced by a point charge can be described by the magnitude with the help of Coulomb's state of force and by direction towards positive charge to the given point charge in electric field.\n\n#### Step 2: Calculations\n1. **Calculate the Electric Field Due to Each Charge**:\nGiven Data:\nCharge $q = 7.60\\ \\mu C=7.60\\times 10^{- 6}C$\nDistance $d = 3.10\\ cm = 0.0310\\ m$\nThe distance from each charge to the point is diagonal, calculated using Pythagoras' theorem:\n$$ r=\\sqrt{d^{2}+d^{2}}=\\sqrt{2d^{2}}=d\\sqrt{2}=0.0310\\sqrt{2}\\ m $$\nSubstituting values:\n$$ r = 0.0310\\sqrt{2}=0.0438\\ m $$\nThe electric field due to one charge is:\n$$ E=\\frac{k|q|}{r^{2}} $$\nSubstituting $k = 8.99\\times 10^{9}\\ N\\cdot m^{2}\/C^{2},q = 7.60\\times 10^{-6}C,r = 0.0438\\ m$:\n$$ E=\\frac{(8.99\\times 10^{9})(7.60\\times 10^{-6})}{(0.0438)^{2}} $$\n$$ E=\\frac{68.324\\times 10^{3}}{0.00191844} $$\n$$ E\\approx3.56\\times 10^{4}\\ N\/C $$\n\n#### Explanation\nThis calculation gives an account of electric field magnitude arising from one of the charges at a specific point using charge and distance.\n\n#### Step 3\n2. **Resolve the Electric Field into Components**\nThe field at the dot is due to two charges symmetrically placed therefore the horizontal components cancel while the vertically directed components add up.\nThe angle between the line joining the charge to the dot and the horizontal is:\n$$ \\theta=\\tan^{- 1}(\\frac{d}{d}) = 45^{\\circ} $$\nThe vertical component of the electric field due to one charge is:\n$$ E_{y}=E\\sin\\theta=E\\sin45^{\\circ}=E\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} $$\nSubstituting $E = 3.56\\times 10^{4}\\ N\/C$:\n$$ E_{y}=3.56\\times 10^{4}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}=3.56\\times 10^{4}\\cdot0.707\\approx2.52\\times 10^{4}\\ N\/C $$\nThe total vertical electric field is the sum of the contributions from both charges:\n$$ E_{net}=2E_{y}=2\\times2.52\\times 10^{4}=5.03\\times 10^{4}\\ N\/C $$\n\n#### Explanation\nThe horizontal forces have equal magnitude and are in opposite directions, thus they are cancelled out. The vertical forces, have equal magnitudes and are in the same direction.\n\n#### Step 4: Analysis of Incorrect Options\n- $7.11\\times 10^{4}\\ N\/C$: This value results from a miscalculation of the distance r or the omission of the symmetry consideration.\n- $1.42\\times 10^{5}\\ N\/C$: This value likely represents the total electric field without resolving into components.\n- $1.01\\times 10^{5}\\ N\/C$: This value may result from doubling the field incorrectly or an error in component calculation.\n\n#### Explanation\nThis value may contain a calculation of the distance as r that should not be there, lack of consideration of the symmetry, the total electric field without polarization into components or an incorrect field and lastly an error in the calculation of components.\n\n#### Answer\nFinal solution:\noption(C): The magnitude of the electric field at the dot is:\n$$ E_{net}=5.03\\times 10^{4}\\ N\/C $$"

    "parsing":"Step 1\n\nWe need to determine:\n1. (T), the tension in the cable, holding the hay bale.\n2. Average horizontal force ($F_h$) exerted by the ground onto the horse's feet.\n\nKnown Data:\n- Mass of the horse: $m_A = 700$ kg\n- Mass of the hay bale: $m_B = 50$ kg\n- Acceleration of the horse: $a_A=0.5$ m\/s\u00b2, left (negative direction)\n- Velocity of the horse: For one - dimension, $v_A = 2$ m\/s (right, positive direction).\n- Position: $r = 8$ m, $\\theta = 60^{\\circ}$\n- Gravitational acceleration: $g = 9.81$ m\/s\u00b2\n\nAssumptions:\n1. It is assumed the pulley is frictionless and massless.\n2. The cable is inextensible.\n3. There is no delay or slack in doing this applying the force.\n\nStep - by - Step Solution:\n\nStep 1: Comprehend the hay bale in motion related to the horse moving\nExplanation:\nThe hay bale moves vertically while the horse moves horizontally; the pulley system made it possible. The vertical acceleration of the hay bale ($a_B$) is just a function of the horizontal acceleration of the horse ($a_A$), at angle $\\theta$.\n\nFrom the geometry of the setup:\n- $a_B=a_A\\cdot\\sin\\theta$\nSubstitute the given values:\n- $a_B = 0.5$ m\/s\u00b2$\\cdot\\sin(60^{\\circ})$\n- $a_B=0.5\\cdot0.866 = 0.433$ m\/s\u00b2\nThus, the vertical acceleration of the hay bale is:\n- $a_B = 0.433$ m\/s\u00b2\n\nStep 2\nStep 2: Calculate the tension in the cable (T)\nThe forces acting on the hay bale are:\n1. The pulling upward tension in the cable (T).\n2. Downward acting weight of the bale ($W_B=m_B\\cdot g$)\n\nFrom Newton's second law for vertical motion of the hay bale:\n- $T - m_B\\cdot g=m_B\\cdot a_B$\nRearranging for T:\n- $T=m_B\\cdot g + m_B\\cdot a_B$\nSubstitute the values:\n- $T=(50$ kg$)\\cdot(9.81$ m\/s\u00b2$)+(50$ kg$)\\cdot(0.433$ m\/s\u00b2$)$\n- $T = 490.5+21.65 = 512.15$ N\nThus, the tension in the cable is:\n- $T = 512.15$ N\n\nStep 3: Find the horizontal force ($F_h$)\nThe forces acting on the horse in the horizontal direction are:\n1. It is also the horizontal force between the ground and the horse's feet ($F_h$) which propels the horse forward.\n2. The component of the cable tension normal to the cable ($T\\cdot\\cos\\theta$), which is in the horizontal direction and opposite to the horse's motion.\n\nFrom Newton's second law for horizontal motion of the horse:\n- $F_h - T\\cdot\\cos\\theta=m_A\\cdot(-a_A)$\nRearranging for $F_h$:\n- $F_h=T\\cdot\\cos\\theta - m_A\\cdot a_A$\nSubstitute the known values:\n- $F_h=(512.15$ N$)\\cdot\\cos(60^{\\circ})-(700$ kg$)\\cdot(0.5$ m\/s\u00b2$)$\n- $F_h=(512.15\\cdot0.5)-350$\n- $F_h = 256.075-350=-93.925$ N\nThe negative sign shows that this horizontal force acts in the opposite direction to the horse's initial motion, which is to the left.\n\nThus, the average horizontal force between the ground and the horse's feet is:\n- $F_h = 93.93$ N (to the left)\n\nAnswer\n\nFinal Answer:\n1. Tension in the cable : $T = 512.15$ N\n2. Average horizontal force: $F_h = 93.93$ N (left)\n\nKey Explanation:\n- We find that the relationship of hay bale motion to that of horse's depends on the angle of rope ($\\theta$) between hay bale and horse.\n- Newton's second law is then applied separately to the vertical motion of the hay bale and the horizontal motion of the horse.\n- In the second, the cable tension is calculated from the vertical forces acting on the hay bale.\n- Balancing the forces acting on the horse generates the horizontal force."

    "parsing":"1. Compute the potential at point $b$ from the effect of $q_1$ and $q_2$.\n   - The potential at point $b$ due to $q_1$ is:\n     - $V_{1b}=\\frac{k\\times q_1}{r_{1b}}$\n     - where $k$ is Coulomb's constant $(9\\times 10^{9}\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C^{2}})$, $q_1$ is the charge of $q_1( + 7.30nC)$ and $r_{1b}$ is the distance from each - specific forefront to point $b$ which in this case is $0.08m$.\n   - The potential at point $b$ due to $q_2$ is:\n     - $V_{2b}=\\frac{k\\times q_2}{r_{2b}}$\n     - where $q_2$ is the charge of $q_2(-7.30nC)$ and $r_{2b}$ is the distance from the quadrupole to point $b$ which in this case is $0.04m$.\n   - Then, the total potential at point $b$ is the sum of the potentials due to $q_1$ and $q_2$:\n     - $V_b = V_{1b}+V_{2b}$\n\nExplanation:\nA point - charge generates energy in the form of an electric field which takes the form of imaginary lines. This originates from a point - charge in all directions, similarly to how spheres expand. In a three - dimensional space, the electric field is represented with the letters $E$ and consists of intensity and direction, thus creating a vector quantity.\n\n2.

Work to microjoules:\n   - $W_{\\mu J}=W\\times10^{6}$\n\nExplanation:\nIn order to shift a charge on the surface from a point in an electric field, work done by the electric field is equal to the work required to shift the negative charge from infinity to a mid - point on the electric field. In an electric field energy is voluntary i.e. negative work is done while moving a charge from positive to negative potentials.\n\nCalculation:\n1. First calculate the potential at specific point $b$ because of $q_1$ and $q_2$\n   - $V_{1b}=\\frac{(9\\times 10^{9}\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C^{2}})\\times(7.30\\times 10^{-9}C)}{0.08m}=817.5V$\n   - $V_{2b}=\\frac{(9\\times 10^{9}\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C^{2}})\\times(- 7.30\\times 10^{-9}C)}{0.04m}=-1642.5V$\n   - $V_b = V_{1b}+V_{2b}=817.5V - 1642.5V=-825V$\n2. Now calculate the work done by electric field\n   - $W=(9.30\\times 10^{-9}C)\\times(-825V)=-7.67\\times 10^{-6}J$\n3. Now convert the work done to microjoules\n   - $W_{\\mu J}=-7.67\\times 10^{-6}J\\times10^{6}=-7.67\\mu J$\n\nExplanation:\nThe unit of work done is a joule denoted by $J$. When changing joules to microjoules, the conversion can be done by multiplying $J$ by $10^{6}$, hence for the case of expressing the work done by the electric field, the value is directly in the $\\mu J$ range and the conversion from $J$ is done by multiplying $10^{6}$.\n\nAnswer\nThe work done by the electric field is calculated as $-7.67\\mu J$ due to the third charge $q_3 = + 9.30nC$ being transferred from infinity to point $b$. The negative sign illustrates that the electric field does work that is counteractive to the movement of the charge."

    "parsing":"**Solution**\n\n**Given Data**:\n- A long solid non - conducting cylinder of radius ($R_1$) is uniformly charged with charge density ($\\rho_E$).\n- It is surrounded by a cylindrical conducting tube with inner radius ($R_2$) and outer radius ($R_3$), which has no net charge.\n- The axes of the two cylinders are parallel but displaced by a distance ($d$).\n- The goal is to find the electric field in the region ($R > R_3$), where ($R$) is the radial distance measured from the axis of the metal cylinder.\n\n**Formula Used**:\nThe electric field ($E$) at a point outside a uniformly charged non - conducting cylinder is calculated using Gauss's law:\n$\\oint\\vec{E}\\cdot d\\vec{A}=\\frac{q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_0}$\n\nWhere:\n- ($q_{enclosed}=\\rho_E\\cdot$ volume enclosed by Gaussian surface)\n- ($\\epsilon_0$) is the permittivity of free space.\nFor displaced axes, the superposition principle is used to account for the shifted charge distribution.\n\n**Expression for Enclosed Charge**\nThe charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface is given by:\n$q_{enclosed}=\\rho_E\\cdot\\pi R_1^{2}L$\n\nWhere:\n- ($L$) is the length of the cylinder (assumed very long).\n- ($R_1$) is the radius of the non - conducting cylinder.\n\n**Explanation**:\nThis formula accounts for the uniform charge density ($\\rho_E$) and the volume of the charged portion of the cylinder enclosed within the Gaussian surface. Only the inner solid cylinder contributes charge as the conducting shell has no net charge.\n\n**Step 2: Electric Field in the Region ($R > R_3$)**\nUsing Gauss's law for a cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius ($R > R_3$), the electric field is radially symmetric and uniform over the surface. Thus:\n$E\\cdot(2\\pi RL)=\\frac{q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_0}$\n\nSubstituting ($q_{enclosed}$):\n$E\\cdot(2\\pi RL)=\\frac{\\rho_E\\pi R_1^{2}L}{\\epsilon_0}$\n\nSimplify to solve for ($E$):\n$E = \\frac{\\rho_E R_1^{2}}{2\\epsilon_0 R}$\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe Gaussian surface captures the total charge of the non - conducting cylinder, and the conducting shell has no net charge contribution. Therefore, the electric field outside depends solely on the charge of the inner cylinder.\n\n**Step 3: Effect of Displacement ($d$)**\nThe displacement ($d$) causes the electric field to no longer point radially outward but results in a non - uniform field at ($R > R_3$). The superposition principle is applied for the resulting field:\n$E=\\frac{\\rho_E R_1^{2}}{2\\epsilon_0 R^{2}}\\cdot\\frac{(R - d)}{\\sqrt{(R - d)^{2}+d^{2}}}$\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe displacement affects the symmetry of the field, requiring a modified expression to account for the shifted axis. The field's magnitude decreases with ($R$), and the angular dependence arises from the offset ($d$).\n\nThe electric field in the region ($R > R_3$) is:\n$E=\\frac{\\rho_E R_1^{2}}{2\\epsilon_0 R^{2}}\\cdot\\frac{(R - d)}{\\sqrt{(R - d)^{2}+d^{2}}}$\n\n**Explanation**:\nThis formula provides the electric field's magnitude and direction, accounting for the non - uniform distribution caused by the displacement ($d$). It is expressed in terms of all the given variables and constants.\n\n**Answer**\n**Final Answer**:\n$E=\\frac{\\rho_E R_1^{2}}{2\\epsilon_0 R^{2}}\\cdot\\frac{(R - d)}{\\sqrt{(R - d)^{2}+d^{2}}}$"

    "answer":"D",
    "parsing":"As per the question asked the answer with a clear explanation is given in the below steps:\n\n**Step 1: Finding Components of Vectors A and B**\nFor vector A (directed at a 90 - degree angle to the x - axis):\n- $A_x=A\\cdot\\cos(90^{\\circ}) = 0$ (since $\\cos(90^{\\circ}) = 0$)\n- $A_y=A\\cdot\\sin(90^{\\circ})=A$ (since $\\sin(90^{\\circ}) = 1$)\nFor vector B:\n- $B_x = B\\cdot\\cos(20^{\\circ})$\n- $B_y=B\\cdot\\sin(20^{\\circ})$\n\n**Explanation: Component Method**\n1. **Breaking down vectors**: Each vector is broken down into its x and y components using trigonometry. For a vector at an angle $\\theta$ from the x - axis, the x - component is found by multiplying the magnitude of the vector by the cosine of its angle: $x = r\\cos(\\theta)$, and the y - component is found by multiplying the magnitude of the vector by the sine of its angle: $y = r\\sin(\\theta)$\n2. **Sign Convention**: It's essential to take into account the direction of the vectors with respect to the coordinate system. In this case, vectors C and D are pointing in directions that have negative x - components and y - components. This is reflected when their angles are adjusted by $180^{\\circ}$ to account for their direction below the x - axis.\n\n**Step 2: Finding Components of Vectors C and D**\nFor vector C (directed at 35 degrees below the - x - axis, so we use $180 + 35$ degrees):\n- $C_x=C\\cdot\\cos(215^{\\circ})$\n- $C_y=C\\cdot\\sin(215^{\\circ})$\nFor vector D (directed at 50 degrees to the - x - axis, so we use $180+50$ degrees):\n- $D_x = D\\cdot\\cos(230^{\\circ})$\n- $D_y=D\\cdot\\sin(230^{\\circ})$\n\n**Explanation**\n1. **Summation of Components**: The x - components of all vectors are added together to get the total x - component of the resultant vector ($R_x$). Similarly, the y - components are summed to get the total y - component ($R_y$)\n2. **Resultant Vector**: Once the total x and y components are found, they are used to form the resultant vector. The magnitude ($R$) of the resultant vector is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: $R=\\sqrt{R_x^{2}+R_y^{2}}$. The direction of the resultant vector is found using the arctan function, specifically the arctan2 function which takes into account the signs of both components to determine the correct quadrant. The direction is given as the angle from the positive x - axis to the resultant vector, measured counter - clockwise.\n3. **Angle Adjusting**: If the resulting angle is negative, it means the vector is below the x - axis. To convert it to a standard positive angle measured counter - clockwise from the positive x - axis, you can add $360^{\\circ}$ to the negative angle.\n\nWe add up all the x - components to find the resultant x - component, and similarly, we add all the y - components to find the resultant y - component. The magnitude of the resultant vector is the square root of the sum of the squares of its x and y components. The direction is given by the arctangent of the y - component over the x - component.\n\nLet's calculate the x and y components for each vector, sum them to get the resultant vector, and then determine the magnitude and direction of the resultant vector.\n\nThe magnitude of the resultant vector when vectors A, B, C, and D are added together is approximately $14.48$ m, and the direction of the resultant vector is approximately $- 158.93^{\\circ}$ from the + x axis.\n\nSince the direction is typically given as a positive angle measured counter - clockwise from the + x axis, we can convert this to a positive angle by adding $360^{\\circ}$ to the negative angle: $360^{\\circ}-158.93^{\\circ}=201.07^{\\circ}$\n\n**Answer**\nTherefore, the direction of the resultant vector is approximately $201.07^{\\circ}$ counter - clockwise from the + x axis."

    "answer":"B",
    "parsing":"Step 1\nIntroduction\nSuch a subtraction, in other words, is termed destructive interference between two waves owing to a path - difference specific. The path difference should involve half the odd multiple of wavelength resulting in the destruction of interference. This occurs when sound waves take two different paths through point Q from a straight vertical part and a portion of a semicircular arc. The task is to find the minimum possible d along which sound waves cannot come together through point Q.\n\nExplanation:\nFor destructive interference, this much path difference must equal half $\\lambda$. The difference between the lengths of the paths covered by the two waves makes the difference in the path length. One then has the lengths of those two paths, equates the difference to half a $\\lambda$, and one is in a position to solve for d.\n\nStep 2\nPath Difference for Destructive Interference: Destructive interference occurs when the path difference between the two waves is an odd multiple of $\\frac{\\lambda}{2}$:\n$\\Delta L=(2n + 1)\\frac{\\lambda}{2},n = 0,1,2,\\cdots$\nThe smallest path difference corresponds to $n = 0$:\n$\\Delta L=\\frac{\\lambda}{2}$\n\nPath Lengths:\n- Path 1 (Straight Path): The straight path length is simply $L_1 = 2d$, as the wave travels down and back up vertically through d.\n- Path 2 (Semicircular Path): The semicircular path has a length equal to half the circumference of a circle with radius r: $L_2=\\pi r$\n\nPath Difference: The path difference between the two waves is:\n$\\Delta L = L_2 - L_1=\\pi r-2d$\n\nFor destructive interference, set $\\Delta L=\\frac{\\lambda}{2}$:\n$\\pi r-2d=\\frac{\\lambda}{2}$\n\nSolve for d: Rearrange the equation to isolate d:\n$2d=\\pi r-\\frac{\\lambda}{2}$\n$d=\\frac{\\pi r-\\frac{\\lambda}{2}}{2}$\n\nSubstitute Given Values:\n- Radius $r = 0.32m$\n- Wavelength $\\lambda=1.60m$ Substituting these values:\n$d=\\frac{\\pi(0.32)-\\frac{1.60}{2}}{2}$\n\nFirst, calculate intermediate steps:\n$\\pi(0.32)=1.0053m$\n$\\frac{1.60}{2}=0.80m$\n$d=\\frac{1.0053 - 0.80}{2}=\\frac{0.2053}{2}=0.1027m$\n\nExplanation:\nFrom the required values for radius of the semicircular arc ($r = 0.32m$) and $\\lambda=1.60m$, it is possible to discover the minimal d hence through knowledge of the path differences in the geometric arrangement. By inserting such information, one gets the answer.\n\nAnswer\nThe smallest d that makes possible destructive interference at point Q is about 0.103m. This ensures, in phases of waves, the destruction of waves, so the waves interfere destructively."

The weight of the leg below the knee is $48.0\\ N$, with the center of gravity located below the knee joint. The leg is being held in this position because of the force $\\vec{M}$ applied by the quadriceps muscle, which is attached $0.100\\ m$ below the knee joint (see the drawing). Obtain the magnitude of $\\vec{M}$.\nKnee joint is marked. The force $\\vec{M}$ makes an angle of $25.0^{\\circ}$ with the line of action related to the leg - muscle connection. The distance from the knee - joint to the point of muscle attachment is $0.100\\ m$, and the distance from the knee - joint to the center of gravity ($cg$) of the leg below the knee is $0.150\\ m$. The leg makes an angle of $30.0^{\\circ}$ with the horizontal.\nWe will use the principle of torque equilibrium. The sum of the torques about the knee - joint is zero, $\\sum\\tau = 0$.\nThe weight of the leg $W = 48.0\\ N$ creates a clock - wise torque $\\tau_{W}$, and the force $\\vec{M}$ creates a counter - clockwise torque $\\tau_{M}$.\nThe torque due to a force $\\vec{F}$ is given by $\\tau=rF\\sin\\theta$, where $r$ is the distance from the pivot point to the point of application of the force, $F$ is the magnitude of the force, and $\\theta$ is the angle between the position vector $\\vec{r}$ (from the pivot point to the point of application of the force) and the force vector $\\vec{F}$.\nFor the weight of the leg, $r_{W}=0.150\\ m$, $\\theta_{W}=30.0^{\\circ}$, and $F = W = 48.0\\ N$. So the torque due to the weight of the leg is $\\tau_{W}=r_{W}W\\sin\\theta_{W}$.\nFor the force $\\vec{M}$, $r_{M}=0.100\\ m$, $\\theta_{M}=(25.0^{\\circ}+ 30.0^{\\circ})=55.0^{\\circ}$. So the torque due to the force $\\vec{M}$ is $\\tau_{M}=r_{M}M\\sin\\theta_{M}$.\nSince the leg is in rotational equilibrium, $\\sum\\tau=\\tau_{M}-\\tau_{W}=0$, which means $r_{M}M\\sin\\theta_{M}=r_{W}W\\sin\\theta_{W}$.\nWe want to solve for $M$. Rearranging the equation gives:\n$$ M=\\frac{r_{W}W\\sin\\theta_{W}}{r_{M}\\sin\\theta_{M}} $$\nSubstituting the given values: $r_{W} = 0.150\\ m$, $W = 48.0\\ N$, $\\theta_{W}=30.0^{\\circ}$, $r_{M}=0.100\\ m$, and $\\theta_{M}=55.0^{\\circ}$\n$$ M=\\frac{0.150\\times48.0\\times\\sin(30.0^{\\circ})}{0.100\\times\\sin(55.0^{\\circ})} $$\n$$ M=\\frac{0.150\\times48.0\\times0.5}{0.100\\times0.819} $$\n$$ M=\\frac{3.6}{0.0819}\\approx43.96\\ N $$\nNumber: $44.0$ (rounded to one decimal place)\nUnits: $N$\n<image>",

    "answer":"B",
    "parsing":"Step 1\nConceptual Introduction :-\nThe problem involves calculating the magnitude of the moment ($\\vec{M}$) about the knee - joint, caused by the force exerted by the quadriceps muscle. The leg is held stationary at a 30\u00b0 angle from the horizontal, with the center of gravity of the leg below the knee - joint. The force of gravity acting on the leg creates a moment, and the quadriceps muscle exerts a force to counteract this moment.\n\nExplanation:\nThe moment ($\\vec{M}$) is the rotational effect produced by a force at a given distance from the pivot point. The quadriceps force must generate a moment to balance the gravitational force acting on the leg.\n\nStep 2\nFormulas :-\n1. Moment Formula:\n$M = F\\times d\\times\\sin(\\theta)$\nWhere:\n$M$ is the moment,\n$F$ is the force (weight of the leg),\n$d$ is the perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of action of the force (in this case, the distance from the knee - joint to the center of gravity of the leg),\n$\\theta$ is the angle between the force and horizontal.\n2. Force Components for Muscle:\nThe quadriceps muscle force $F_q$ is balanced by the moment created by the weight of the leg:\n$M = F_q\\times0.100\\times\\sin(25^{\\circ})$\n(where 0.100 m is the distance from the knee - joint to where the quadriceps force is applied).\n\nExplanation:\nThe formula for the moment helps determine the force needed from the quadriceps to balance the leg's weight. The angle and distance play key roles in calculating the moment arm.\n\nStep 3\nCalculation :-\n1. Calculate the Moment due to the Weight of the Leg:\nThe weight of the leg is given as 48.0 N, with the center of gravity 0.150 m below the knee - joint. The leg makes a 30\u00b0 angle with the horizontal, so:\n$M_{weight}=48.0\\ N\\times0.150\\ m\\times\\sin(30^{\\circ})$\n$M_{weight}=48.0\\times0.150\\times0.5$\n$ = 3.60\\ Nm$\n2. Determine the Force $F_q$ Applied by the Quadriceps:\nThe quadriceps force $F_q$ generates a counteracting moment at a distance of 0.100 m from the knee - joint. Balancing the moment due to the weight of the leg:\n$M_{weight}=F_q\\times0.100\\times\\sin(25^{\\circ})$\nSolving for $F_q$:\n$3.60 = F_q\\times0.100\\times0.4226$\n$F_q=\\frac{3.60}{0.100\\times0.4226}$\n$=\\frac{3.60}{0.04226}$\n$\\approx85.1\\ N$\n\nExplanation:\nThe moment from the quadriceps force is calculated by balancing it against the moment from the leg's weight. The quadriceps force is determined by the known dimensions and angles.\n\nAnswer\nThe magnitude of the force exerted by the quadriceps muscle is 85.1 N."

    "parsing":"- **Explanation**:\n    - To solve this question we need to understand how RC - circuits behave in two situations mentioned in the question. First is immediately after the switch is closed, the capacitor behaves as a short - circuit and all currents flow through it. Second is a long time after the switch is closed, the capacitor behaves as an open - circuit and no current flows through it.\n    - Redrawing the circuits for both cases:\n        - When the capacitor is a short - circuit, we can replace the capacitor by a plain wire. The circuit has resistors $30\\Omega$, $20\\Omega$, $15\\Omega$ and $5\\Omega$ connected as shown.\n        - When the capacitor is an open - circuit, we can replace the capacitor by open wires. The circuit has resistors $30\\Omega$, $20\\Omega$, $15\\Omega$ and $5\\Omega$ connected as shown.\n2nd step\n- **Explanation**:\n    - To calculate the current through the battery, we need to find the equivalent resistance of the circuit. Since no current will flow through the $15\\Omega$ resistor (both ends of the resistor have the same potential difference), we simplify the circuit.\n    - The $20\\Omega$ and $5\\Omega$ resistors are in parallel. The formula for resistances in parallel is $\\frac{1}{R_{eq}}=\\frac{1}{R_1}+\\frac{1}{R_2}$, and for series it is $R_{eq}=R_1 + R_2$.\n    - $\\frac{1}{R_{eq1}}=\\frac{1}{20}+\\frac{1}{5}=\\frac{5 + 20}{20\\times5}\\Omega$, so $R_{eq1}=\\frac{20\\times5}{20 + 5}=4\\Omega$.\n    - The $4\\Omega$ is in series with $30\\Omega$, so the equivalent resistance of the circuit is $R_{eq}=(4 + 30)\\Omega=34\\Omega$.\n    - Using Ohm's law $V = IR_{eq}$, where $V = 20V$, $I=\\frac{V}{R_{eq}}=\\frac{20}{34}A\\approx0.59A$.\n3rd step\n- **Explanation**:\n    - To calculate the current through the battery, we find the equivalent resistance of the circuit. Since the $20\\Omega$ resistor circuit is opened (because of the open - circuit capacitor), it isn't a part of the circuit anymore.\n    - The $15\\Omega$ and $5\\Omega$ resistors are in series, and their equivalent is in series with $30\\Omega$ resistor. All the resistors are in series connection.\n    - $R_{eq}=(30 + 15+5)\\Omega = 50\\Omega$.\n    - Using Ohm's law $V = IR_{eq}$, where $V = 20V$, $I=\\frac{V}{R_{eq}}=\\frac{20}{50}A = 0.4A$.\n\n- **Answer**:\n    - a) The current across when the switch is just closed is $i = 0.59A$.\n    - b) The current across when the switch is closed for a long time is $i = 0.4A$.\n![](images\/149729723_9ca2279c562c1d836008b2e2ef90b69c3a48f5304e909f20c560f243b1cd08d7.jpg)\n![](images\/149729723_4ccae59d579cb6a43a5309a0602d434ed3166d241ca06d2eb7bdc6961bc1ac84.jpg)\n![](images\/149729723_780cf2fcfd5d97c11394eceb39e526cb306757c743b47cd149b622b31b3cfcc3.jpg)\n![](images\/149729723_5adc4d964565e1a9735f602424de439252eadaa800922c185cc84a7f207af61f.jpg)"

This means the phase difference is $\\pi$ radians, which corresponds to a path length difference of $\\frac{1}{2}$ wavelength.\nThus, the correct answer is:\n(d) $\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nExplanation:\nThe red wave is the phase - inverted version of the blue wave, meaning it has a phase difference of $\\pi$ radians. This corresponds to a path length difference of $\\frac{1}{2}$ wavelength.\n\nStep 2\nQuestion 6: Wavelength of the Waves\nThe general sine wave equation is:\n$y = A\\sin(kx)$\nwhere $k=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$ is the wave number. Given in the equation:\n$k = 7\\pi$\nwe solve for wavelength $\\lambda$:\n$\\lambda=\\frac{2\\pi}{k}=\\frac{2}{7}$\nThus, the wavelength of these waves is:\n$\\frac{2}{7}$ units\n\nExplanation:\nThe wave number $k$ is related to wavelength $\\lambda$ by $k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$. Given $k = 7\\pi$, solving gives $\\lambda=\\frac{2}{7}$ units.\n\nStep 3\nQuestion 7: Why did the amplitude of the red wave decrease?\nThe red wave has an amplitude of $-3$, meaning its absolute amplitude is the same as the blue wave, but it appears out of phase. A possible explanation for a decrease in amplitude could be partial absorption or interference caused by benzene, which may have introduced some attenuation.\n\nExplanation:\nIf benzene is acting as an absorbing medium, it could have reduced the intensity of the wave passing through it. This would explain why the amplitude of the red wave appears to have decreased.\n\nAnswer\n5) (d) $\\frac{1}{2}$\n6) $\\frac{2}{7}$ units\n7) The amplitude of the red wave decreased due to absorption or attenuation by benzene."

    "answer":"### Introduction and Overview of the Question\nThe task involves analyzing position - time graphs to understand motion. The first graph depicts the position of an object over time. Using this graph, we aim to:\n1. Describe the motion in terms of walking patterns (e.g., speeding up, slowing down, constant speed, standing still).\n2. Create corresponding velocity - time and acceleration - time graphs using calculations and proper formulas.\n\nExplanation:\nThe key to understanding motion using position - time graphs is to describe the motion, including changes in speed and acceleration, and construct corresponding velocity and acceleration graphs.\n\n### Analyzing Graph 2 (Position vs. Time)\n#### Observations:\n- The graph starts at the origin (0, 0), indicating the motion begins from rest.\n- The slope increases between 0 and 3 seconds, indicating speeding up.\n- The slope becomes constant from 3 to 6 seconds, indicating motion at a constant speed.\n\n#### Motion Description:\n- From 0 to 3 seconds: The person accelerates, moving away from the starting position.\n- From 3 to 6 seconds: The person moves at a constant speed.\n\nExplanation:\nThe graph shows two phases of motion: an initial phase where the object speeds up and a second phase where it moves at a steady speed. These phases indicate accelerating and constant motion.\n\n### Calculating Velocity and Acceleration\n#### Velocity Calculation:\nVelocity is determined using the formula $v=\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}$\nWhere:\n- $(\\Delta x)$ - change in position\n- $(\\Delta t)$ - change in time\n\n**For 0 - 3 seconds**:\n- Initial position ($t = 0$), position ($x = 0$ m)\n- Final position ($t = 3$ seconds), position ($x = 5$ m)\n$v=\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{5 - 0}{3-0}=\\frac{5}{3}\\text{ m\/s}\\approx1.67\\text{ m\/s}$\n\n**For 3 - 6 seconds**:\n- Position at ($t = 6$ seconds): ($x = 10$ m)\n- Position at ($t = 3$): ($x = 5$ m)\n$v=\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{10 - 5}{6 - 3}=\\frac{5}{3}\\text{ m\/s}=1.67\\text{ m\/s}$\n\n#### Acceleration Calculation:\nAcceleration is calculated using $a=\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}$\n\n**From 0 - 3 seconds**:\n- Initial velocity ($v_0 = 0$ m\/s)\n- Final velocity ($v = 1.67$ m\/s)\n$a=\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{1.67-0}{3 - 0}=\\frac{1.67}{3}\\text{ m\/s}^2\\approx0.56\\text{ m\/s}^2$\n\n**From 3 - 6 seconds**:\n- Velocity remains constant ($1.67$ m\/s)\n$a=\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{1.67 - 1.67}{6 - 3}=0\\text{ m\/s}^2$\n\nExplanation:\nThe velocity graph represents how speed changes over time, showing an increasing trend followed by a constant rate. The acceleration graph highlights the change in velocity: a non - zero value in the first phase and zero in the second phase.\n\n### Final Answer:\n1. **Position vs. Time Description**:\n   - From 0 to 3 seconds: The object is accelerating as the slope of the graph increases.\n   - From 3 to 6 seconds: The object moves at a constant speed as the slope becomes linear.\n2. **Velocity Calculations**:\n   - From 0 to 3 seconds: $v=\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{5}{3}\\approx1.67\\text{ m\/s}$\n   - From 3 to 6 seconds: $v=\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{5}{3}=1.67\\text{ m\/s}$\n3. **Acceleration Calculations**:\n   - From 0 to 3 seconds: $a=\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{1.67 - 0}{3}\\approx0.56\\text{ m\/s}^2$\n   - From 3 to 6 seconds: $a=\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{1.67-1.67}{3}=0\\text{ m\/s}^2$\n4. **Final Graph Interpretations**:\n   - **Position vs. Time Graph**: Curved from 0 - 3 seconds (accelerating), linear from 3 - 6 seconds (constant speed).\n   - **Velocity vs. Time Graph**: Linear increase from 0 - 3 seconds, constant at ($1.67\\text{ m\/s}$) from 3 - 6 seconds.\n   - **Acceleration vs. Time Graph**: Constant at ($0.56\\text{ m\/s}^2$) from 0 - 3 seconds, then zero from 3 - 6 seconds.\n\nThe graphs above represent the following:\n1. **Position vs. Time Graph**: Depicts the object's movement, accelerating from 0 to 3 seconds and then moving at a constant speed from 3 to 6 seconds.\n2. **Velocity vs. Time Graph**: Shows the linear increase in velocity from 0 to 3 seconds (acceleration phase) and a constant velocity from 3 to 6 seconds.\n3. **Acceleration vs. Time Graph**: Displays a constant acceleration of ($0.56\\text{ m\/s}^2$) from 0 to 3 seconds, followed by zero acceleration from 3 to 6 seconds.\n![](images\/65be687ce7f92796c5b6647510edb3e14668a335eb61a5160d0238bd50486bc1.jpg)\n![](images\/6aed466939217aa04ba4a4fe44f3aa24714e2a61c5ac992c8710fcf5f6c61e6d.jpg)\n![](images\/ca798d46db2b926afe51ec2337fc46aebab5f72db2cb1af9795bdb77549b4c96.jpg)",

    "options":"",
    "answer":"Step 1\nIntroduction:\nTo solve this problem, we hope to find the center of mass (COM) of the water molecule which is made up of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms.\n\nExplanation:\nThe oxygen atom is located in the coordinate origin and two hydrogen atoms are on the coordinate around the oxygen atom (96.0 pm)at angles of (104.5\u00b0) between the two hydrogen atoms. The masses of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms have been provided as (16.0 u) and (1.0 u) respectively. The center of mass is that point which must be adopted as representing the whole mass of the molecule. In particular, to add weights of the center of mass the coordinates of each atom and their mass and relative to a Cartesian system.\n\nStep 2\nThe process to find the centre of mass involves the following steps:\nStep 1: Understanding the Problem and Coordinate Setup\nWe place the oxygen atom ($m_O = 16.0$ u)at the origin, ($x_O,y_O$) = (0,0), and assign Cartesian coordinates to the two hydrogen atoms ($m_H = 1.0$ u):\n1. Hydrogen - 1 is located at a distance (r = 96.0 pm)and an angle of ($- 52.25^{\\circ}$) from the positive x - axis.\n2. Hydrogen - 2 is located at the same distance but at an angle of ($+ 52.25^{\\circ}$) from the positive x - axis.\nThese angles are derived from the fact that the bond angle between the two hydrogen atoms is ($104.5^{\\circ}$), which splits symmetrically as ($52.25^{\\circ}$) above and below the x - axis.\n\nStep 2: Calculating the Coordinates of the Hydrogen Atoms\nThe Cartesian coordinates of Hydrogen - 1 and Hydrogen - 2 can be computed using trigonometric relationships. For a point in polar form, (r, $\\theta$), the Cartesian coordinates are given by:\n$x=r\\cos(\\theta)$, $y = r\\sin(\\theta)$\n- For Hydrogen - 1:\n$x_1=r\\cos(-52.25^{\\circ})=96.0\\cdot\\cos(-52.25^{\\circ})$\n$y_1=r\\sin(-52.25^{\\circ})=96.0\\cdot\\sin(-52.25^{\\circ})$\n- For Hydrogen - 2:\n$x_2=r\\cos(52.25^{\\circ})=96.0\\cdot\\cos(52.25^{\\circ})$\n$y_2=r\\sin(52.25^{\\circ})=96.0\\cdot\\sin(52.25^{\\circ})$\nSince the cosine function is symmetric, ($\\cos(-\\theta)=\\cos(\\theta)$), and the sine function is antisymmetric, ($\\sin(-\\theta)=-\\sin(\\theta)$), we find:\n- ($x_1 = x_2=r\\cos(52.25^{\\circ})$)\n- ($y_1=-r\\sin(52.25^{\\circ})$ and ($y_2 = r\\sin(52.25^{\\circ})$)\n\nExplanation:\nStep 1: Understanding the Problem and Coordinate Setup\nHere we demonstrate our comprehension of the problem and the coordinate setting. We put the oxygen atom at coordinate (0,0) for convenience; thus the hydrogen atoms are located at equidistant points. This setup makes sure that the shape of the water molecule as well as the symmetry has been well portrayed as it calculates.\nStep 2: Finding the Coordinates of the Hydrogen Atoms\nTo do this work, the method of converting polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates is easier to work out the exact positions of the hydrogen atoms with reference to the oxygen atom.\n\nStep 3\nStep 3: Centre of Mass Formula\nThe centre of mass coordinates ($x_{cm},y_{cm}$) are calculated using:\n$x_{cm}=\\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}m_ix_i}{M}$, $y_{cm}=\\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}m_iy_i}{M}$\nHere:\n- ($m_O = 16.0$ u, ($x_O,y_O$) = (0,0))\n- ($m_H = 1.0$ u, ($x_1,y_1$)) and ($x_2,y_2$)\nThe total mass of the system is:\n$M=m_O + m_H+m_H=16.0 + 1.0+1.0 = 18.0$ u\nSubstituting the coordinates of each atom:\n1. For ($x_{cm}$):\n$x_{cm}=\\frac{m_Ox_O+m_Hx_1+m_Hx_2}{M}$\nSince ($x_O = 0$), this simplifies to:\n$x_{cm}=\\frac{m_Hx_1 + m_Hx_2}{M}$\nUsing ($x_1 = x_2=r\\cos(52.25^{\\circ})$), we get:\n$x_{cm}=\\frac{2m_Hr\\cos(52.25^{\\circ})}{M}$\n2. For ($y_{cm}$):\n$y_{cm}=\\frac{m_Oy_O+m_Hy_1+m_Hy_2}{M}$\nAgain, since ($y_O = 0$), this becomes:\n$y_{cm}=\\frac{m_Hy_1 + m_Hy_2}{M}$\nSubstituting ($y_1=-r\\sin(52.25^{\\circ})$ and ($y_2 = r\\sin(52.25^{\\circ})$), we find:\n$y_{cm}=\\frac{-m_Hr\\sin(52.25^{\\circ})+m_Hr\\sin(52.25^{\\circ})}{M}=0$\n\nStep 4: Final Computation\nUsing the value ($\\cos(52.25^{\\circ})\\approx0.6157$):\n$x_{cm}=\\frac{2\\times1.0\\times96.0\\times0.6157}{18.0}=\\frac{118.6}{18.0}\\approx6.59$ pm\nAnd for ($y_{cm}$), as calculated earlier:\n$y_{cm}=0$\nThus, the center of mass is located at:\n($x_{cm},y_{cm}$)=($6.59$ pm,0)\n\nExplanation:\nStep 3: Centre of Mass Formula\nThe centre of mass formula provides exactly the right measures of the mass and position of all atoms of a body. By evaluating these contributions and adding them up, one is able to compute for the position of the molecule as weighted average.\nStep 4: Final Computation\nSupposing the values and using the symmetry to simplify it brings the answer to the next concluding - level logical. The x - coordinate stands for the asymmetry resulting from the greater mass of oxygen atom, the y - coordinate equals zero because of two equivalent hydrogen atoms.\n\nAnswer\nConclusion:\nThe COM of the water molecule is diagonally slightly in the positive x direction if the y and z axes are the reference as Oxygen is heavier than the two hydrogen molecules. The final coordinates are approximately:\nThe center of mass of the satellite is located at the following coordinates: $x_{cm}=6.59$ pm and $y_{cm}=0$\nThis result corresponds to the structure of water by breaking up this globe into oxygen and two hydrogens with the center of gravity nearer to the oxygen slew but pushed away because the two hydrogen spheres are balanced thereby creating the spherical water molecule.",

So, $T=5.00\\mathrm{kg}\\times9.8\\mathrm{m\/s}^2 = 49.0\\mathrm{N}$.\n   - The spring - scale measures tension of both sides of the string.

For the hanging mass, the force due to gravity is $mg$, and for the mass on the incline, the force along the incline is $mg\\sin\\theta$.\n   - Substituting $m = 5.00\\mathrm{kg}$, $g = 9.8\\mathrm{m\/s}^2$, and $\\theta = 30^{\\circ}$ into $T = mg\\sin\\theta$.\n   - $T=5.00\\mathrm{kg}\\times9.8\\mathrm{m\/s}^2\\times\\sin(30^{\\circ})=5.00\\times9.8\\times0.5 = 24.5\\mathrm{N}$.\n   - The spring - scale measures this tension, so $T = 24.5\\mathrm{N}$.\n\n**Answers**:\n- For the horizontal pulley system, the spring - scale reads $98.0\\mathrm{N}$.\n- For the vertical pulley system, the spring - scale reads $49.0\\mathrm{N}$.\n- For the inclined - plane system, the spring - scale reads $24.5\\mathrm{N}$.",

The formula is:\n$$ Analog\\ Value=\\frac{V_{in}}{V_{ref}}\\times1023 $$\nwhere $V_{in}$ is the voltage at port A0, and $V_{ref}$ is the reference voltage (5V for standard Arduino).\nGiven $V_{in}=4.1667V$ (calculated earlier) and $V_{ref} = 5V$\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n$$ Analog\\ Value=\\frac{4.1667}{5}\\times1023=0.8333\\times1023 = 852.67 $$\nSince the returned value must be an integer, round it to the nearest whole number: $Analog\\ Value = 853$\n\n### Answer\n- At A0 (Part a): The voltage present at port A0 is approximately 4.17 V.\n- For `analogRead()` (Part b): The `analogRead()` function would return 853.",

    "question":"1. **Find the tension in a vertical strand of spider - web**:\n   - When a spider of mass $m = 7.00\\times10^{-5}\\text{ kg}$ hangs motionless on a vertical strand of spider - web, the force acting on the spider in the vertical direction is given by Newton's second law $F = ma$. Since the spider is motionless ($a = 0$), the net force $\\sum F_y=T - mg=0$, where $T$ is the tension in the web and $g = 9.8\\text{ m\/s}^2$.\n   - Solving for $T$, we get $T = mg$.\n   - Substitute $m = 7.00\\times10^{-5}\\text{ kg}$ and $g = 9.8\\text{ m\/s}^2$ into the formula: $T_{vertical}=mg=(7.00\\times10^{-5}\\text{ kg})\\times(9.8\\text{ m\/s}^2)=6.86\\times10^{-4}\\text{ N}$.\n2. **Find the tension in a horizontal strand of spider - web**:\n   - When the spider sits motionless in the middle of a horizontal strand of spider - web that sags at an angle $\\theta = 10.0^{\\circ}$ below the horizontal, let the tension in the web be $T_{horizontal}$.\n   - The vertical components of the two tension forces (one on each side of the spider) balance the weight of the spider. The vertical component of each tension force is $T_{vertical - component}=T_{horizontal}\\sin\\theta$. Since there are two such components, $\\sum F_y = 2T_{horizontal}\\sin\\theta\u2212mg = 0$.\n   - Solving for $T_{horizontal}$, we get $T_{horizontal}=\\frac{mg}{2\\sin\\theta}$.\n   - Substitute $m = 7.00\\times10^{-5}\\text{ kg}$, $g = 9.8\\text{ m\/s}^2$, and $\\theta = 10.0^{\\circ}$ into the formula. $\\sin(10.0^{\\circ})\\approx0.1736$, so $T_{horizontal}=\\frac{(7.00\\times10^{-5}\\text{ kg})\\times(9.8\\text{ m\/s}^2)}{2\\times0.1736}\\approx1.97\\times10^{-3}\\text{ N}$.\n3. **Find the ratio of the tension in the horizontal strand to the tension in the vertical strand**:\n   - The ratio $\\frac{T_{horizontal}}{T_{vertical}}=\\frac{\\frac{mg}{2\\sin\\theta}}{mg}=\\frac{1}{2\\sin\\theta}$.\n   - Substitute $\\theta = 10.0^{\\circ}$ into the formula: $\\frac{1}{2\\times0.1736}\\approx2.88$.\nSo, the tension in the vertical strand is $T_{vertical}=6.86\\times10^{-4}\\text{ N}$, the tension in the horizontal strand is $T_{horizontal}\\approx1.97\\times10^{-3}\\text{ N}$, and the ratio $\\frac{T_{horizontal}}{T_{vertical}}\\approx2.88$.\n<image>",

    "answer":"Step 1\n\nQuestion 1: Multiple Choice\nThe expressions given are for the superposition of two waves $(y_1)$ and $(y_2)$:\n- $(y_1=\\sin(\\pi x - 2\\pi t))$\n- $(y_2=\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}x + 2\\pi t))$\n\nExplanation:\nWe are looking for the correct expression that shows how these waves combine (superposition).\nSince $(y_1)$ and $(y_2)$ are being added, we need the sum $(y_1 + y_2)$. The correct choice should represent this sum, not a product or any other operation.\nThe correct answer is the option with:\n$[y_1 + y_2=\\sin(\\pi x - 2\\pi t)+\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}x + 2\\pi t)]$\nThis matches the superposition principle, where the resulting wave is the sum of the individual waves.\n\nStep 2\n\nQuestion 2: Matching\nFor this part, we need to extract properties like amplitude, wavelength, frequency, and wave velocity from the equations of $(y_1)$ and $(y_2)$.\n- Amplitude: The coefficient in front of the sine function. Both $(y_1)$ and $(y_2)$ have no coefficients, so their amplitude is 1.\n- Wavelength: The wavelength $(\\lambda)$ is related to the spatial part of the wave equation $(\\sin(kx))$, where $(k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda})$. For $(y_1)$, $(k=\\pi)$, so $(\\lambda=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\pi}=2)$. For $(y_2)$, $(k = \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, so $(\\lambda=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} = 4)$.\n- Frequency: The frequency $(f)$ is related to the time part $(\\sin(\\omega t))$, where $(\\omega = 2\\pi f)$. For $(y_1)$, $(\\omega = 2\\pi)$, so $(f = 1)$. For $(y_2)$, $(\\omega = 2\\pi)$, so $(f = 1)$ as well.\n- Wave Velocity: $(v = f\\lambda)$. For $(y_1)$, $(v=1\\times2 = 2)$. For $(y_2)$, $(v = 1\\times4=4)$.\n\nQuestion 3: Matching\n\nExplanation:\nThe graphs correspond to the visual representation of the given equations. You need to compare the given waveforms and identify the correct plot for each.\n- The superposition of $(y_1)$ and $(y_2)$ shows a pattern that is neither purely $(y_1)$ nor $(y_2)$ but a combination.\n- $(y_1)$ has a higher frequency compared to $(y_2)$, which has a lower frequency and a longer wavelength.\n\nStep 3\n\nFrom the descriptions, it seems:\n- Plot C corresponds to the superposition $(y_1 + y_2)$.\n- Plot A corresponds to $(y_1)$ since it shows a higher frequency.\n- Plot B corresponds to $(y_2)$ since it shows a lower frequency and longer wavelength.\n\nQuestion 4: Multiple Choice\n\nExplanation:\nThe question asks whether the superposition forms a simple harmonic oscillation.\nSimple harmonic oscillation is a repetitive movement back and forth through an equilibrium position in a sine or cosine pattern.\nBased on the graph (Plot C) of the superposition:\n- The pattern of the superposition is not a single sine or cosine wave, but it might have a repeating pattern that could resemble a combination of harmonic oscillations.\nSo, the best answer here would be:\n- Yes. The pattern clearly repeats regularly.\n\nAnswer\nThe correct expression for the superposition is $(y_1 + y_2)$. Both waves have an amplitude of 1, wavelengths of 2 and 4, frequencies of 1, and wave velocities of 2 and 4, respectively. Plot A corresponds to $(y_1)$, Plot B to $(y_2)$, and Plot C to the superposition. The superposition shows a regular repeating pattern, indicating simple harmonic oscillation.",

    "answer":"**Explanation**:\nThe problem involves using both graphical and computational approaches to analyze the image formed by a concave - mirror. To solve it, we need to apply the mirror equation and the magnification equation.\nThe mirror equation is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{f}=\\frac{1}{d_{o}}+\\frac{1}{d_{i}} $$\nwhere:\n- $f$ is the focal length of the mirror.\n- $d_{o}$ is the object distance (distance from the object to the mirror).\n- $d_{i}$ is the image distance (distance from the image to the mirror).\nThe magnification ($m$) is given by:\n$$ m =-\\frac{d_{i}}{d_{o}}=\\frac{h_{i}}{h_{o}} $$\nwhere:\n- $h_{i}$ is the image height.\n- $h_{o}$ is the object height.\nSince the radius of curvature ($R$) is $40mm$ for the concave mirror, the focal length ($f$) is $\\frac{R}{2}$, which is $20mm$ (remember, for a concave mirror, the focal length is negative).\n**Given**:\n- $R=- 40mm$ (negative because the mirror is concave)\n- $f=\\frac{R}{2}=-20mm$\n- $d_{o}=60mm$\n- $h_{o}=20mm$\n\n2nd step\nNow, let's apply the mirror equation to find ($d_{i}$):\n$$ \\frac{1}{-20}=\\frac{1}{60}+\\frac{1}{d_{i}} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{i}}=\\frac{1}{-20}-\\frac{1}{60} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{i}}=\\frac{-3 - 1}{60} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{i}}=-\\frac{4}{60} $$\n$$ d_{i}=-\\frac{60}{4} $$\n$$ d_{i}=-15mm $$\n**Explanation**:\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is formed on the same side of the mirror as the object, which means it is a real image.\nNow, let's calculate the magnification ($m$):\n$$ m =-\\frac{d_{i}}{d_{o}} $$\n$$ m =-\\frac{-15}{60} $$\n$$ m=\\frac{15}{60} $$\n$$ m=\\frac{1}{4} $$\n**Explanation**:\nSince magnification is positive, the image is upright with respect to the object. The height of the image ($h_{i}$) can be found as:\n$$ h_{i}=m\\times h_{o} $$\n$$ h_{i}=\\frac{1}{4}\\times20mm $$\n$$ h_{i}=5mm $$\n\n**Answer**\n**Final Answer**\nSo, the image is $5mm$ tall, which is one - fourth the size of the object, and since the magnification is positive, the image is upright.\nTo answer the questions:\na) The distance of the image with respect to the mirror is $-15mm$ (meaning $15mm$ in front of the mirror), and the height of the image above the optical axis is $5mm$.\nb) The magnification of the image with respect to the object is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\nc) The image is real because it is formed by actual convergence of rays and is on the same side of the mirror as the object (indicated by the negative image distance).",

    "answer":"The given diagram shows three charges, which have equal magnitudes and are arranged vertically. The issue we're trying to solve here is the direction of the net electric field at point X.\n\n**Explanation**:\nPrincipally, the electric field due to the point - charge is collapsing with the distance from it which is squared. Positive charge induces the field of electricity in such a way that it is always symmetrical to the charge with respect to the direction.\nTo find the net electric field at point X, we consider the contribution of each charge to the electric field at that point:\nPoint X will have the greatest effect on the charge which is closest to it, since the latter is at a very near distance.\nThe second charge will contribute to a smaller force because of it's located further to the first.\nThe charged particle situated at the closest point to the proton will feel the strongest force; the one at the next point will feel a weaker force; and so on, with the charge that is the farthest away from the proton feeling its effect the most weakly.\nSince charges have the positive sign and their electric - field vectors are pointed along their direction (away from positive charges), the electric field at point X due to every charge will direct to the right. Here, despite differing distances, each field would be proportional varying in the sizes.\nAt point X, the net point - charge electric field will be the vector addition of the fields due to each charge. In this case all the such fields are the same and they converge in one direction i.e. to the right. However the force of the net field will be less than 3 times the field of the nearest charge which suffers from the inverse - square law's effect.\nLacking in numerical values, we can not calculate the value of the net electric field, but an industrial person can provide assure that the direction will be to the right, conforming the principle of superposition for the electric fields.\n\n**Answer**\nthe final answer is :\nthat the direction will be to the right",

    "answer":"To find the single displacement (magnitude and direction) that the expert golfer would take to sink the ball in the hole from the same initial point, we need to determine the net displacement required.\n\n**Explanation**:\nWe can break down the given displacements into their horizontal (east - west) and vertical (north - south) components.\nLet's denote:\n$d1 = 4.02m$ north first displacement\n$d2 = 2.06m$ northeast second displacement\n$d3 = 1.10m$ at 30 degrees west of south\n\nWe'll calculate the horizontal and vertical components separately:\n\n**Step 2: Horizontal components**\n**Explanation**:\nThe second displacement of 2.06m northeast can be broken down into its east and north components. Since northeast is 45\u00b0 from both north and east, its horizontal and vertical components are equal.\n$d2e* = d2n$ or $th=\\frac{2.06}{\\sqrt{2}}m$\n**Explanation**:\nThe third displacement is at 30.0\u00b0 west of south, so its horizontal component is:\n$d3(west)=d3\\times\\cos(30)$\nNow, the total horizontal displacement:\nHorizontal displacement = $d2(e*) - d3(west)$\n\n**Step 3: Vertical Components**\n- The first displacement is directly north, so its vertical component is 4.02m.\n- The second displacement is at 45\u00b0 north of east, so its vertical component is the same as its horizontal component, i.e., $\\frac{2.06}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n- The third displacement is 30.0\u00b0 west of south, so its vertical component is $d3(south)=d3\\times\\sin(30)$\n- Now, the total vertical displacement:\nVertical displacement = $d1 + d2north - d3south$\n\n**Step 4: Magnitude and Direction of Net Displacement**\nUse the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the net displacement\nMagnitude of Net Displacement = $\\sqrt{(horizontal)^2+(vertical)^2}$\n**Explanation**:\nUse inverse trigonometric functions to find the direction:\nDirection = $\\arctan(\\frac{vertical displacement}{horizontal displacement})$\nHorizontal displacement = $1.456m - 0.952m\\approx0.504m$\nVertical displacement = $4.02m + 1.456m - 0.55m\\approx4.926m$\n**Explanation**:\nThe magnitude of the net displacement is\n$\\sqrt{(0.504)^2+(4.926)^2}=\\sqrt{0.244016 + 24.265476}=4.951m$\nThe direction is:\n$\\arctan(\\frac{4.926}{0.504})=\\arctan(9.7857)=84.5$ degrees\n\n**Answer**\nSo, the expert golfer could make the hole in approximately 4.951m north of east at an angle of 84.5 degree from the eastward direction.",

The problem is to determine the thickness of the film, $\\delta$ in terms of the distance $s$ as it descends, applying mass conservation and integrating the derived equation to obtain the expression for $\\delta$.\n\nExplanation:\nIn part (a), mass balance is applied along a conical surface for a small liquid ring. Assuming a constant flow, where there is symmetry, the mass - conservation equation is reduced to:\n$\\frac{d}{ds}(s\\delta v)=0$ or $\\frac{d}{ds}(s\\delta^{3}) = 0$\nwhere $\\delta$ is the thickness of the film, $v$ is the flow velocity, and $s$ is the distance it descends along the cone.

    "answer":"---\n1. **Step 1**\n    - **Introduction**\nElectric flux, an essential electromagnetism concept, is used to calculate the number of electric - lines of force passing through surfaces. It tells us about the interaction of electric fields and objects and its surfaces nearby. Knowledge of electric flux is necessary for the analysis of various physical scenarios in which impinging electric fields interact with the shapes and materials. This is why we are probing the behavior of electric flux around a prism - shaped object array in a uniform electric field so as to calculate the electric flux through each of its surfaces by using the orientation of the surfaces.\n    - **Explanation**\nIn the given context, the electric field is directed along the x - direction with a strength of 700 N\/C. There are quite a few faces of the prism, each oriented differently relative to the electric field. As such, it is fairly easy to deduce from the orientation of any surface whether any electric - field lines pass through them and to subsequently calculate the electric flux. Now the whole storyline is therefore titled about the relationship between the direction of the electric field and the normal phenomena of the surfaces, which it perceives, resulting in the so - called quantum of flux available to any given surface at any given time.\n2. **Step 2**\n    - Electric flux ($\\varPhi$) is a measure of the number of electric - field lines passing through a surface. The electric flux through a surface is calculated using the formula:\n$\\varPhi=\\vec{E}\\cdot\\vec{A}=EA\\cos\\theta$\nwhere:\n    - $\\vec{E}$ is the electric - field vector,\n    - $\\vec{A}$ is the area vector of the surface,\n    - $\\theta$ is the angle between the electric field and the surface normal.\nThe problem involves a prism - shaped object in a uniform electric field of 700N\/C, directed along the x - axis. We calculate the electric flux through each specified surface based on their orientation and dimensions.\n    - **Explanation on Surfaces**\n        - **Surface I (Back Surface)**:\n            - Surface I is perpendicular to the y - axis.\n            - Since the electric field is parallel to the x - axis, it makes a 90\u00b0 angle with the surface normal.\n            - $\\cos90^{\\circ}=0$, so no electric - field lines pass through this surface.\n$\\varPhi_{I}=EA\\cos\\theta = 700\\cdot A\\cdot\\cos90^{\\circ}=0$\n$\\varPhi_{I}=0\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C}$.\n        - **Surface II (Bottom Surface)**:\n            - Surface II is parallel to the xz - plane.\n            - The electric field is along the x - axis, so it is parallel to the surface.\n            - $\\cos90^{\\circ}=0$, so no electric - field lines pass through this surface.\n$\\varPhi_{II}=EA\\cos\\theta = 700\\cdot A\\cdot\\cos90^{\\circ}=0$\n$\\varPhi_{II}=0\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C}$.\n        - **Surface III (Left End)**:\n            - Surface III is perpendicular to the x - axis.\n            - The area of this surface is: $A = h\\cdot d=(40.0cm)\\cdot(30.0cm)=0.4\\times0.3 = 0.12m^{2}$.\n            - The electric field passes into the surface (negative flux direction).\n$\\varPhi_{III}=EA\\cos\\theta = 700\\cdot0.12\\cdot\\cos180^{\\circ}=- 700\\cdot0.12=-84\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C}$.\n        - **Surface IV (Right End)**:\n            - Surface IV is also perpendicular to the x - axis but faces outward.\n            - The area of this surface is the same as Surface III: $A = 0.12m^{2}$.\n            - The electric field exits the surface (positive flux direction).\n$\\varPhi_{IV}=EA\\cos\\theta = 700\\cdot0.12\\cdot\\cos0^{\\circ}=700\\cdot0.12 = 84\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C}$.\n    - **Explanation**\nIn the assignment to determine the electric flux for each surface, the first step was to find horizons about each face of the prism with respect to the direction of the electric field. The electric - field lines cross the surfaces that are parallel to the electric field will be such that the angle between the surface normal and the electric field exactly 90 degrees so they would not have any electric flux across such surfaces. Alternatively, those surfaces, which are completely at right angles to the electric field lines, will receive maximum flux, irrespective of whether the field is entering or leaving, depending on the direction of the orientation. By considering the alignment of every surface against the electric field, a precise description of the electric flux of each of the surfaces is achieved.\n\n3. **Answer**\nIn conclusion, the electric flux across the four surfaces of the prism is like this; the flux of the first surface (Back) is $0\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C}$, and the second surface (Bottom) has zero flux too; these two surfaces present the entire prism with inclination toward the electric field. The third one (Left) is perpendicular in orientation and faces inward; hence it has an electric flux of $- 84\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C}$, depicting the entry of electric - field lines. And the fourth (right) end changing the angle produces an electric flux of $84\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C}$ owing to the electric - field lines away from the end. These findings underline the symmetry of the electric flux within a uniform electric field and confirm that the net flux across the closed prism is 0, agreeing with Gauss's Law.",

    "answer":"**Step 1**\nExplanation:\nAnalyzing the forces given in the diagram\nThe forces acting on the box are:\n$F_1$ acts horizontally to the left ($-\\hat{x}$ direction), $F_2$ acts at an angle in the top - right quadrant (has both $\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{y}$ components) and $F_3$ acts at an angle in the bottom - right quadrant (has both $\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{y}$ components).\nSince, the box is stationary, the net force acting on it must be zero, i.e\n$\\vec{F}_{net}=\\vec{F}_1+\\vec{F}_2+\\vec{F}_3+\\vec{F}_4 = 0$\nHere, $F_4$ is the missing force that need to be determined.\n\n**Step 2**\nExplanation:\nResolving the forces into components and writing the net - force equation\nBy using the diagram given in question we can resolve the forces as:\n- $F_1$ acts only in the $-\\hat{x}$ direction, hence the components are $F_{1x}=-\\vert F_1\\vert$, $F_{1y} = 0$\n- $F_2$ makes an angle $\\theta_2$ (assume) with the horizontal, hence the components are $F_{2x}=\\vert F_2\\vert\\cos\\theta_2$, $F_{2y}=\\vert F_2\\vert\\sin\\theta_2$\n- $F_3$ makes an angle $\\theta_3$ (assume) with the horizontal, below the $x$ - axis, so the components are $F_{3x}=\\vert F_3\\vert\\cos\\theta_3$, $F_{3y}=-\\vert F_3\\vert\\sin\\theta_3$\nFor equilibrium ($\\vec{F}_{net}=0$):\n1. Net force in the $\\hat{x}$ direction:\n$F_{1x}+F_{2x}+F_{3x}+F_{4x}=0$\n2. Net force in the $\\hat{y}$ direction:\n$F_{1y}+F_{2y}+F_{3y}+F_{4y}=0$\nSubstituting the known components:\n$-F_1 + F_2\\cos\\theta_2+F_3\\cos\\theta_3+F_{4x}=0$\n$0 + F_2\\sin\\theta_2 - F_3\\sin\\theta_3+F_{4y}=0$\nUpon solving these equations, we get\n$F_{4x}=F_1 - F_2\\cos\\theta_2 - F_3\\cos\\theta_3$\n$F_{4y}=-F_2\\sin\\theta_2 + F_3\\sin\\theta_3$\nThe magnitude of $F_4$ is\n$F_4=\\sqrt{F_{4x}^2 + F_{4y}^2}$\nThe angle of $F_4$ (relative to the horizontal) is\n$\\theta_4=\\tan^{- 1}(\\frac{F_{4y}}{F_{4x}})$\n\n**Step 3**\nExplanation:\nAdding the $\\vec{F}_4$ to the diagram\nDraw $\\vec{F}_4$ as a vector starting from the box, pointing in the direction determined by $\\theta_4$, with magnitude $F_4$. It should balance the forces $F_1$, $F_2$ and $F_3$.\n\n**Step 4**\nExplanation:\nAnalyzing the effect of the net force and writing the net - force equation\nCalculation of the net force by force by summing the contributions from $F_1$, $F_2$, and $F_3$ in both the $\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{y}$ directions.\nTherefore,\n$F_{net,x}=-F_1 + F_2\\cos\\theta_2+F_3\\cos\\theta_3$\n$F_{net,y}=F_2\\sin\\theta_2 - F_3\\sin\\theta_3$\n$\\vec{F}_{net}=F_{net,x}\\hat{x}+F_{net,y}\\hat{y}$\nNow, analyzing the effect of the net force,\nIf the net force is zero, the box will move with constant velocity in the $-\\hat{x}$ direction (as per Newton's first law). The motion is unaffected by the forces since they cancel each other.\nIf the net force is not zero, the box will experience an acceleration ($\\vec{a}=\\frac{\\vec{F}_{net}}{m}$). The acceleration will have components in the $\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{y}$ directions.\n\n**Step 5**\nExplanation:\nDescribing the future motion of the box and the final trajectory\nThe initial velocity of the box is in the $-\\hat{x}$ direction. The force components in the $\\hat{x}$ direction ($F_{net,x}$) will either slow it down, speed it up, or change its direction depending on the sign and magnitude of $F_{net,x}$.\nIf $F_{net,y}\\neq0$, the box will acquire velocity in the $\\hat{y}$ direction over time. This will cause the box to move in a curved trajectory rather than a straight line.\nThe components of the acceleration are:\n$a_x=\\frac{F_{net,x}}{m}$, $a_y=\\frac{F_{net,y}}{m}$\nThe velocity and position of the box evolve as:\n$v_x = v_{0x}+a_x t$, $v_y = v_{0y}+a_y t$\nand the displacement: $x(t)=x_0 + v_{0x}t+\\frac{1}{2}a_x t^2$, $y(t)=y_0 + v_{0y}t+\\frac{1}{2}a_y t^2$\nThe trajectory of the box will depend on the relative magnitudes and directions of $a_x$ and $a_y$. If $F_{net,x}$ and $F_{net,y}$ are nonzero, the box will follow a curved path.\nIf the net force in one direction is zero, the box will maintain its velocity in that direction.\nIf the net force in both directions is zero, the box will continue moving at constant velocity in the $-\\hat{x}$ direction.\n\nAnswer\nThe answers of both the questions had been described.\n![](images\/6294db13d93da12418d83604c1693e1a4e2381fe5bd7cb7059c5560a3aa25061.jpg)",

    "answer":"Step 1\n\nPart (a): Determining tension in the slanted cable\n\nThe following is presented to us:\n- Weight of the hanging object: $W = 48,\\text{N}$\n- Angle of the slanted cable: $\\theta=35^{\\circ}$\n\nThe tension in the slanted cable $T_{slant}$ can be found using vertical force equilibrium. The vertical component of the tension in the slanting cable counteracts the weight of the object.\n\nForce Balance in the Vertical Direction:\n$T_{slant}\\sin\\theta = W$\nThis means:\n$T_{slant}=\\frac{W}{\\sin\\theta}$\nHence,\n$T_{slant}=\\frac{48}{\\sin35^{\\circ}}$\n\nLet's substitute the calculated value of $\\sin35\\approx0.5736$\n$T_{slant}=\\frac{48}{0.5736}=83.7,\\text{N}$\n\nExplanation:\nThere is a 48 N weight that is suspended by two cables, one at an angle of $35^{\\circ}$ and the other horizontal. We will need to analyze the forces acted on that system as we look to solve for the tensions in these cables. The slanted cable serves two purposes; it provides a vertical support to balance the weight and a horizontal pull to counter - balance the tension in the horizontal cable. With an understanding of how forces can be split into vertical and horizontal components, we can determine the necessary tension in each cable to maintain equilibrium.\n\nStep 2\n\nPart (b): Determine tension in the horizontal cable\n\nThe horizontal component of tension in the slanted cable is equaled by tension of the horizontal cable $T_{horizontal}$\n\nForce Balance in the Horizontal Direction:\n$T_{horizontal}=T_{slant}\\cos\\theta$\nSubstituting the specific values, we get:\n$T_{horizontal}=83.7\\cdot\\cos35^{\\circ}$\nSo, we need to calculate the $\\cos$ of 35:\n$T_{horizontal}=83.7 - 0.8192\\approx68.5,\\text{N}$\n\nExplanation:\nThe slanted cable provides the most support through its vertical component which means that its tension must be greater than the weight of the object because part of its tension is directed upwards. The horizontal cable is positioned to counteract the angled cable's tension. The horizontal cable is capable of tension but is weaker than the horizontal pull of the slanted cable. Because the slanted cable is pulling at an angle, the resultant Horizontal cable tension will also need to less than the slanted Cable tension. Together, these tensions will ensure that the weight will be held still without overturning the structure.\n\nAnswer\n\n(a) Tension in the slanted cable: 83.7N\n(b) Tension in the horizontal cable: 68.5N",

    "question":"(Thrust Vectoring Control) The vertical landing of SpaceX's Falcon - 9 requires positioning the rocket upright. This can be achieved through a gimbaled engine, a thrust engine attached with a hydraulically actuated nozzle via a ball joint. To simplify the problem, we only consider the dynamics in yaw direction, as shown in Figure 1. During landing, the gimbal reports its angle to flight computers which calculate the error output used to steer the nozzle to deviate thrust from the center line. The deviation will generate a torque on the center of gravity, correcting the gimbal angle.\nFigure 1: Thrust vectoring control of rockets.

    "answer":"Step 1\n\nGiven\nThe problem involves thrust vectoring control in SpaceX's Falcon - 9. The goal is to create a functional block diagram that includes proper signal annotations, block names, and units. Additionally, the error calculation and torque generation steps need to be computed with sample values to provide a complete solution.\n\nExplanation:\nThe problem involves thrust vectoring control for SpaceX's Falcon - 9 during vertical landing. The objective is to design a functional block diagram, including error calculations and torque generation, with proper signal annotations.\n\nStep 2\n\nSOLUTION\n\nSystem Setup and Assumptions\nAssumptions for this example:\nGimbal angle (measured) = 5\u00b0 (deviation from center line)\nDesired gimbal angle (center line) = 0\u00b0 (aligned with center line)\nGain factor for torque generation = 10 Nm\/\u00b0\n\nCalculation and Functional Block Diagram Construction\n1. Gimbal Angle (\u00b0): The initial gimbal angle (measured) is 5\u00b0, which is the deviation from the center line. This is the input to the system.\nGimbal Angle (measured) = 5\u00b0\n2. Error Calculation (\u00b0): The error between the measured gimbal angle and the desired gimbal angle is calculated as:\n$[Error = Gimbal Angle (Measured)-Gimbal Angle (Desired)=5^{\\circ}-0^{\\circ}=5^{\\circ}]$\nError = 5\u00b0\n3. Torque Generation (Nm): Using the error value, the torque is generated based on the gain factor. The formula for torque is:\n$[Torque = Error\\times Gain Factor = 5^{\\circ}\\times10\\ Nm\/^{\\circ}=50\\ Nm]$\nTorque = 50 Nm\n4. Gimbal Angle Correction (\u00b0): The torque value is used to adjust the gimbal angle to correct the deviation. The gimbal angle correction would lead to a reduction in the error and align the thrust line with the center line.\n\nExplanation:\nThe system involves measuring the gimbal angle deviation, calculating the error between the desired and actual angles, generating torque to correct this error, and then adjusting the gimbal angle to realign the thrust vector.\n\nAnswer\n\nFinal Answer\nThe final functional block diagram of the thrust vectoring control system with sample values includes:\n1. Gimbal Angle (\u00b0) = 5\u00b0Measured angle of deviation.\n2. Error Calculation (\u00b0) = 5\u00b0Difference between measured and desired gimbal angles.\n3.

Specifically, it refers to the energy spent to rotate a lever where the lever arm is fixed at an angle from the lever's base.\n\nExplanation:\nIn the context of systems skeletons, torque is the adequate force that rotates the body about the pivot, hence making the body to rotate. The adequately applied force on the object must overcome the inertia of the object for it to rotate.\n\nStep 2\nFormulas : -\n1.

    "answer":"**Solution**\n\n**Step 1**\n**ANSWER**:\nIn this problem, we will deal with the interaction of light with a thin soap film that gives an idea about refraction, interference, and optical path difference. As light strikes the film, part of it reflects off from the top surface, while the part refracts, travels through the film, and reflects from the bottom surface. The two reflected rays interfere because of the difference in their travel path and in phase shifts. Depending on the thickness of the film, the wavelength of light, and the refractive indices, this interference generates either bright (constructive) or dark (destructive) fringes. Path difference is the phase shift generated in the thin film due to incidence and refraction angles. A phase shift will also happen when reflecting from the top surface due to a higher refractive index of the film than in air; hence further complication.\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe interference pattern is dependent upon the combined effect of the geometric path traveled by light inside the film and the additional phase shift due to the reflection. Refraction will change the direction of the light ray inside the film and induce a change in total optical path difference. The total wave crest that occurs due to constructive interference will happen if the path difference is in a positive phase relationship. In the opposite case, destructive interference will occur where there is a phase reversal of the crest.\n\n**Step 2**\n1. **Application of Snell's Law**\n$\\Delta = m\\lambda$ (for $m = 0,1,2,\\ldots$)\nSolve for $\\phi$:\n$\\Delta=(m + \\frac{1}{2})\\lambda$ (for $m = 0,1,2,\\ldots$)\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe angle of refraction $\\phi$ determines the path taken by light within the soap film. The refractive index $n$ of the film and incidence angle $\\theta$ in air govern this.\n\n2. **Calculate Geometric Path Difference**\nThe light travels through the soap film from $A$ to $B$ and back, with a geometric distance:\n$AB=\\frac{d}{\\cos\\phi}$, so total travel is $2AB = \\frac{2d}{\\cos\\phi}$\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe thickness $d$ and angle $\\phi$ determine the real path length inside the film and is accounted by the refractive index $n$ in the formula for optical path difference.\n\n3. **Optical Path Difference**\nThe optical path difference between the two reflected rays is:\n$\\Delta = 2n\\frac{d}{\\cos\\phi}-\\frac{\\lambda}{2}$\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe path difference accounts for the phase shift due reflection at the surface of the denser medium (the top of the film).\n\n4. **Conditions for Constructive Interference**\nFor constructive interference (bright fringe):\n$2n\\frac{d}{\\cos\\phi}-\\frac{\\lambda}{2}=m\\lambda$\nRearrange:\n$2n\\frac{d}{\\cos\\phi}=(m + \\frac{1}{2})\\lambda$\n\n**Explanation**:\nConstructive interference occurs when the path difference equals an integer multiple of the wavelength.\n\n5. **Conditions for Destructive Interference**\nFor destructive interference (dark fringe):\n$2n\\frac{d}{\\cos\\phi}-\\frac{\\lambda}{2}=(m+\\frac{1}{2})\\lambda$\nRearrange:\n$2n\\frac{d}{\\cos\\phi}=(m + 1)\\lambda$\n\n**Explanation**:\nDestructive interference occurs when the path difference equals an odd multiple of $\\lambda\/2$.\n\n**Answer**\nUsing Snell's Law and the optical path difference formula, the conditions for constructive and destructive interference are derived as:\n1. Constructive interference: $2n\\frac{d}{\\cos\\phi}=(m+\\frac{1}{2})\\lambda$\n2. Destructive interference: $2n\\frac{d}{\\cos\\phi}=(m + 1)\\lambda$",

This is because bucket on rope 1 has a larger mass, resulting in a greater vertical force $mg$ and a reduced angle relative to vertical.",

    "answer":"Step 1\n\nTheory\n\nTo find the electric potential at a point through several point - charges arranged in an equilateral triangle. Electric potential is a scalar quantity associated with a point charge or an electric field, and it is defined as the amount of work done in bringing a positive unit charge from infinity to that point. $\\sigma$ - surface density charge - the electric field does not depend on the shape of the charge. In contrast to electric force, which is a vector quantity that requires vector addition, electric potentials can be directly added algebraically, greatly simplifying the calculations involved.\n\nIn Part A, three equal positive charges are arranged in an equilateral triangle on the corners. Net potential at the centroid is purely positive, calculated by adding contributions of three charges.\n\nIn Part B, one of the charges is flipped to negative, but the other two remain positive. The fact that it is a negative charge means it contributes negatively to the total potential, thereby decreasing the net result. It shows that the sign and magnitudes of charges matter, because their electric potential can increase or decrease the total work required to arrange a test charge to that point.\n\nPart A: Electric Potential at Point (P)\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe electric potential created because of to a point charge written to as:\n$V = k_{e}\\frac{Q}{r}$\n\nHere, every separate charge is $(+Q = + 1\\mu C)$, and $(r = 2m)$ is the separation of each charge from the point (P).\n\n1. Potential because of to one charge:\n$V_{single}=k_{e}\\frac{Q}{r}$\nSubstituting $(k_{e}=8.99\\times10^{9}\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C^{2}}),(Q = 1\\times10^{- 6}C)$, and $(r = 2m)$:\n$V_{single}=\\frac{(8.99\\times10^{9})(1\\times10^{-6})}{2}$\n$V_{single}=4,495V$\n2. net potential at (P) :\nmoreover there are three same \/ identical charges:\n$V_{total}=3\\times V_{single}=3\\times4,495 = 13,485V$\n\nStep 2\n\nPart B: New Electric Potential if the Top Charge is Negative\n\nExplanation:\n\nIf the upper charge get $(-1\\mu C)$, while the other two remain $(+1\\mu C)$, the net potential at (P) is the add of the potentials:\n\n1. Potential because of the two $(+1\\mu C)$ charges particles:\n$V_{+}=2\\times4,495 = 8,990V$\n2. Potential due to the $(-1\\mu C)$ charge particles:\n$V_{-}=-4,495V$\n3. net total potential:\n$V_{total}=V_{+}+V_{-}=8,990 - 4,495 = 4,495V$\n\nStep 3\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a model example of why electric potential depends on configuration, the size of point charges, and their signs! Since potentials are scalar entities, it can directly added together. In Part A, positive charges are same distance from centroid hence, positive net potential. The configuration is symmetrical so the calculation is simple and shows that electric potential is additive.\n\nIn Part B, we penetrate this idea more, and the net potential decreases when the introduced point return is negative, highlighting how we care as much about the charge sign as we do about the charge magnitude. The above example shows the balance between attractive and repulsive effects in electrostatics. Image guidance extends the electric potential concept, where energy distribution on the charge creates the electric field in the location.\n\nAnswer\n\nFinal Answers:\n- Part A: $(V = 13,485V)$.\n- Part B: $(V = 4,495V)$.",

    "answer":"Step 1\n\nGiven:\n1. Mass of the marble block ($m_1$) = 2,600kg.\n2. Ramp angle ($\\theta$) = ($10^{\\circ}$).\n3. Each worker's maximum pulling force ($F_{worker}$) = 350N.\n4. The rope is parallel to the ramp.\n5. The ramp is friction - free (no friction).\n\nObjective:\n1. Draw a force diagram and indicate the unit vectors.\n2.

The objective is to calculate the rope tension, normal force, and the number of workers needed to balance the system.\n\nStep 2\n\n\n(i) Force Diagram\nThe following forces act on the marble block:\n1. Weight of the block ((W)): Acts vertically downward, given by ($W = m_1\\cdot g$), where ($g = 9.8m\/s^{2}$).\n2. Tension in the rope ((T)): Acts parallel to the ramp and up the incline.\n3. Normal reaction force ((R)): Acts perpendicular to the ramp surface.\n\nUnit Vectors\n(i): Direction parallel to the ramp (positive along the ramp upward).\n(j): Direction perpendicular to the ramp (positive normal to the ramp surface).\n\nComponents of Forces:\n1. Weight ((W)):\n($W_x=W\\sin\\theta = m_1\\cdot g\\cdot\\sin\\theta$)\n($W_y = W\\cos\\theta=m_1\\cdot g\\cdot\\cos\\theta$)\n2.

The total number of workers required to balance the tension (T) is:\n$n=\\frac{T}{F_{worker}}=\\frac{4,421.33}{350}=12.63$\nSince the number of workers must be an integer, a minimum of 13 workers is required.\n\n(iv) Modelling Assumptions:\n1. Smooth ramp: Assumes no friction between the block and the ramp, simplifying the calculations by ignoring frictional forces.\n2. Uniform rope tension: Assumes the tension is distributed evenly along the rope, making calculations straightforward without considering variations in tension.\n\nExplanation:\nThe forces acting on the block include weight, tension, and normal reaction. The tension balances the parallel component of the weight along the ramp. The normal reaction opposes the perpendicular component. Calculations determine the tension in the rope and the reaction force. Finally, the total pulling force is divided by each worker's capacity to find the required number of workers.\n\nAnswer\n\nFinal Answer\n1. Tension in the rope:\n$(4,421.33N)\\to2$ sign - if icantfigures:$(4,400N)$.\n2. Normal reaction force:\n$(25,080.70N)\\to2$ sign - if icantfigures:$(25,000N)$\n3. Minimum number of workers: (13).",

Its total energy is the sum of the kinetic energy due to the box's motion and the potential energy due to the change in the length of the spring.\nInitially, the spring can be assumed to be at its original length; hence, the potential energy becomes zero. So the total initial energy becomes equal to the initial kinetic energy.\nWhen the box comes to rest by compressing the spring, its kinetic energy becomes zero but it gains potential energy. So the total final energy becomes equal to the final potential energy.\n\n**Step 2**\nThe work done by the friction force on a box moving on a horizontal plane is,\n$$ W =-\\mu_{k}mg(d + x)\\tag{3} $$\nwhere $\\mu_{k}$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $d$ is the initial distance of the box from the spring.\n\nAs per work - energy theorem,\n$$ E_{f}-E_{i}=W\\tag{4} $$\n\nUsing equations (1), (2), and (3) in equation (4),\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}-\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}=-\\mu_{k}mg(d + x) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}=\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}-\\mu_{k}mg(d + x) $$\n$$ k=\\frac{mv^{2}-2\\mu_{k}mg(d + x)}{x^{2}}\\tag{5} $$\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe work done by the friction force on a body depends on the distance traveled by it on the surface. The box first travels a distance $d$ before striking the spring and then travels an additional distance $x$ while compressing the spring. The friction force opposes motion and so the work done by it is negative.\nThe work - energy theorem says that the work done on a body is equal to the change in its energy.\n\n**Step 3**\nThe mass is $m = 5.1\\ kg$\nThe distance $d=16.7\\ m$ and $x = 45\\ cm=0.45\\ m$\nThe coefficient of kinetic friction is $\\mu_{k}=0.48$\nThe acceleration due to gravity is $g = 9.80\\ m\/s^{2}$\nThe initial speed of the box is $v = 16.6\\ m\/s$\n\n**NOTE**: $1\\ cm=0.01\\ m$.

    "answer":"We are given a pressure - volume graph for an engine and a refrigerator and need to find whether the work done in different processes is positive or negative.\n\n**Step 1: Principle of work - energy theorem in thermodynamics**\nThe work done by a gas during a thermodynamic process can be determined by calculating the area under the pressure - volume (PV) graph representing the process. When a gas undergoes a change in volume while maintaining a certain pressure (or a change in pressure while maintaining a certain volume), work is done by or on the gas. The work done ($W$) by the gas during the process is equal to the area under the curve of the PV graph representing the process.\nThe work done can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the type of process and the direction of the volume change.\n - If gas is expanding (volume increases and the work is done by the system), work in this case is taken to be positive.\n - If the gas is under compression (the volume will decrease and the work is done on the system), work done in this process will be taken as negative.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis for engine**\nIn the engine's PV - graph:\n - In process a, the gas is under expansion. The area of the red - shaded region is positive. So, $W_{a}=+\\text{ve}$\n - In process b, the gas is under compression. The area of the blue - shaded region is negative.

    "answer":"Step 1\nConceptual Introduction:\nIn vector mathematics, understanding the relationships between vectors in geometric shapes such as parallelograms is fundamental. A parallelogram is defined by its two pairs of equal and parallel sides, which can be represented by vectors. The vectors representing the sides of the parallelogram can be used to express other vectors, such as diagonals or resultants, within the shape. This problem requires expressing the vector $\\vec{R}$ in terms of the vectors $\\vec{A}$, $\\vec{B}$, $\\vec{C}$, and $\\vec{D}$ which represent the edges of a parallelogram.\nExplanation:\nThe significance of this conceptual framework lies in its application to vector addition and subtraction, which are essential operations in physics and engineering for determining resultant forces, displacements, and other vector quantities. By understanding how to express one vector in terms of others within a parallelogram, one can solve complex problems involving vector components and their interactions.\n\nDetailed Step - By - Step Solution:\nStep 1: Identify the Properties of the Parallelogram\nIn a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in magnitude and direction. Therefore, the vectors representing these sides satisfy the following relationships:\n$\\vec{A}=\\vec{C}$ and $\\vec{B}=\\vec{D}$\nThis equality is crucial because it allows the simplification of vector expressions by substituting one vector for another.\nExplanation:\nRecognizing that opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal helps in reducing the number of unique vectors in the problem. This simplification is essential for expressing $\\vec{R}$ in terms of the given vectors.\n\nStep 2\nStep 2: Express $\\vec{R}$ Using Vector Addition\nOne of the diagonals of the parallelogram can be expressed as the sum of two adjacent vectors. For instance, if $\\vec{R}$ represents a diagonal, it can be expressed as:\n$\\vec{R}=\\vec{A}+\\vec{B}$\nThis is because, in vector addition, the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by two vectors is the sum of those vectors.\nExplanation:\nVector addition is used here to find the resultant vector that spans from one corner of the parallelogram to the opposite corner. This step leverages the geometric interpretation of vector addition in parallelograms.\n\nStep 3\nStep 3: Verify the Expression with Given Options\nReview the provided options to find the one that matches the derived expression:\n$\\vec{R}=\\vec{A}+\\vec{B}$\nThis corresponds to option 4 in the list:\n4. $\\vec{R}=\\vec{B}+\\vec{A}$\nSince vector addition is commutative, $\\vec{A}+\\vec{B}$ is equivalent to $\\vec{B}+\\vec{A}$.\nExplanation:\nVerification ensures that the derived expression aligns with one of the provided options, confirming the correctness of the solution.\n\nStep 4: Consider Alternative Expressions for $\\vec{R}$\nWhile $\\vec{R}=\\vec{A}+\\vec{B}$ is a valid expression, other expressions might also be valid depending on the specific definition of $\\vec{R}$. For example, if $\\vec{R}$ represents the other diagonal, it could be expressed as:\n$\\vec{R}=\\vec{A}-\\vec{B}$\nThis corresponds to option 5 in the list:\n5. $\\vec{R}=\\vec{A}-\\vec{B}$\nBoth expressions are valid depending on the direction and definition of $\\vec{R}$.\nExplanation:\nConsidering alternative expressions ensures a comprehensive understanding of how $\\vec{R}$ can be represented based on different geometric interpretations within the parallelogram.\n\nAnswer\n\nConclusion:\nThe vector $\\vec{R}$ in a parallelogram can be effectively expressed in terms of the edge vectors $\\vec{A}$, $\\vec{B}$, $\\vec{C}$, and $\\vec{D}$. By leveraging the properties of parallelograms, vector addition, it is determined that $\\vec{R}=\\vec{A}+\\vec{B}$ (option 4) and $\\vec{R}=\\vec{A}-\\vec{B}$ (option 5) are valid expressions depending on the specific geometric context. This solution demonstrates the application of vector mathematics to geometric problems, providing a clear and methodical approach to expressing vectors within parallelograms.",

The leaves gain the same negative charge and repel each other.\nSo this option is the correct one.\n(B) This image shows positive charge on both the leaves and the ball.\nThis images means that positive charges move in the conductor which is not possible.\nThe leaves cannot both gain positive charges through induction while the ball remains positive.\nThis option is hence incorrect.\n(C) This image shows no movement of charges.\nThe negatively charged rod near the electroscope, it induces a charge separation. So this option is wrong.\n(D) This image shows negative charges on the ball and positive charges on the leaves.\nWhen a negatively charged rod is near, electrons are repelled downward and not attracted upward. So this option is incorrect.\n(E) This image shows negative charges on both the leaves and the ball.\nThe negative charges are repelled from the ball, so they cannot accumulate on both the leaves and the ball simultaneously. Hence, this option is also incorrect.\n\nExplanation:\nElectrostatic induction is the process of redistribution of electric charge in an object due to the presence of nearby charged object.\n\nAnswer\nThe image which describes what happens is option A.\nThe correct answer is option A.",

    "answer":"**Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Torque on the loop and its behavior**\n\n**Step 1: Magnetic moment of the loop**\nThe magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ of a current - carrying loop is given by:\n$\\vec{\\mu}=I\\cdot\\vec{A}\\cdot\\hat{n}$\nWhere:\n- $I$ is the current in the loop.\n- $\\vec{A}=a\\cdot b$ is the area of the rectangular loop ($a$ and $b$ are the sides of the rectangle).\n- $\\hat{n}$ is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane of the loop, determined by the right - hand rule.\nThus:\n$|\\vec{\\mu}| = I\\cdot(a\\cdot b)$\n\n**Step 2: Torque on the loop**\nThe torque $\\vec{\\tau}$ on the loop in a magnetic field $\\vec{B}_{ext}$ is:\n$\\vec{\\tau}=\\vec{\\mu}\\times\\vec{B}_{ext}$\nThe magnitude of the torque is:\n$|\\vec{\\tau}|=|\\vec{\\mu}|\\cdot|\\vec{B}_{ext}|\\cdot\\sin\\theta$\nSubstituting the value of $|\\vec{\\mu}|$:\n$\\tau = I\\cdot(a\\cdot b)\\cdot B_{ext}\\cdot\\sin\\theta$\n\n**Step 3: Behavior of the loop**\nThe torque will try to align the magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ with the external magnetic field $\\vec{B}_{ext}$. If the loop is not held in place:\n- It will rotate to minimize the angle $\\theta$, eventually aligning $\\vec{\\mu}$ parallel to $\\vec{B}_{ext}$.\n- This happens because the system tries to reach a state of minimum potential energy.\nExplanation:\nAs for the torque applied to the loop, current, the dimensions of the loop, magnetic field and angle $\\theta$ characterize the torque. Due to this torque, the loop will rotate in order to keep $\\theta$ as small as possible, i.e., bring $\\vec{\\mu}$ into line with $\\vec{B}_{ext}$. This behavior is as a result of the system looking forward to minimizing its magnetic potential energy.\n\n**Step 2: Equation of motion**\n\n**Step 1: Torque and small - angle approximation**\nFrom Part 1, the torque is:\n$\\tau = I\\cdot(a\\cdot b)\\cdot B_{ext}\\cdot\\sin\\theta$\nFor small angles ($\\theta\\approx0$), we use the approximation $\\sin\\theta\\approx\\theta$. The torque becomes:\n$\\tau\\approx I\\cdot(a\\cdot b)\\cdot B_{ext}\\cdot\\theta$\n\n**Step 2: Rotational dynamics**\nUsing the rotational form of Newton's second law:\n$\\tau = I_{total}\\cdot\\alpha$\nWhere:\n- $I_{total}$ is the moment of inertia of the loop about the axis of rotation.\n- $\\alpha=\\frac{d^{2}\\theta}{dt^{2}}$ is the angular acceleration.\nSubstituting $\\tau$:\n$I\\cdot(a\\cdot b)\\cdot B_{ext}\\cdot\\theta = I_{total}\\cdot\\frac{d^{2}\\theta}{dt^{2}}$\nThis simplifies to:\n$\\frac{d^{2}\\theta}{dt^{2}}+\\omega^{2}\\theta = 0$\nWhere:\n$\\omega^{2}=\\frac{I\\cdot(a\\cdot b)\\cdot B_{ext}}{I_{total}}$\n\n**Step 3: Solution of the equation**\nThe equation:\n$\\frac{d^{2}\\theta}{dt^{2}}+\\omega^{2}\\theta = 0$\nis a simple harmonic motion (SHM) equation. Its solution is:\n$\\theta(t)=\\theta_{0}\\cos(\\omega t+\\phi)$\nWhere:\n- $\\theta_{0}$ is the initial angular displacement.\n- $\\phi$ is the phase constant determined by initial conditions.\n- $\\omega=\\sqrt{\\frac{I\\cdot(a\\cdot b)\\cdot B_{ext}}{I_{total}}}$ is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n\n**Step 4: Reversing the current direction**\nIf the current ($I$) is reversed, the direction of the magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ reverses. As a result:\n- The torque $\\vec{\\tau}=\\vec{\\mu}\\times\\vec{B}_{ext}$ also reverses direction.\n- This reversal causes the loop to rotate in the opposite direction, trying to align the new $\\vec{\\mu}$ with $\\vec{B}_{ext}$.\nExplanation:\nFor small angles the loop oscillates simple harmonically as the torque seeks to restore the loop to an equilibrium position. The angular frequency ($\\omega$) here is a loop current - dependent together with the dimensions of the loop, magnetic field and the moment of inertia experienced by the moment of inertia. Basically, when the current flow direction is reversed, the torque produced sets the loop in reverse motion, thus achieving the desired performance.\n\n**Answer**\n(a) $\\tau = I\\cdot(a\\cdot b)\\cdot B_{ext}\\cdot\\sin\\theta$. The loop rotates to align its magnetic moment with $\\vec{B}_{ext}$.\n(b) $\\frac{d^{2}\\theta}{dt^{2}}+\\omega^{2}\\theta = 0$, with $\\omega=\\sqrt{\\frac{I\\cdot(a\\cdot b)\\cdot B_{ext}}{I_{total}}}$. The motion is SHM.\n(c) Reversing $I$ reverses $\\vec{\\mu}$ and $\\vec{\\tau}$, causing opposite rotation.",

    "answer":"The graph shows the velocity of an object moving in a straight - line over time.\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe object starts at rest (velocity = 0 m\/s) at time 0 s. The object's velocity increases steadily to 30 m\/s at time 2 s. The object maintains a constant velocity of 30 m\/s from time 2 s to time 5 s. The object's velocity decreases steadily to 50 m\/s at time 8 s.\n\n**Total displacement**:\nThe total displacement of the object can be found by calculating the area under the velocity - time graph. The graph can be divided into three sections:\n- **Section A**: A triangle with base from 0 to 2 s and height 30 m\/s. The area of this section is $\\frac{1}{2}\\times2\\times30 = 30m$.\n- **Section B**: A rectangle with base from 2 s to 5 s and height 30 m\/s. The area of this section is $3\\times30 = 90m$.\n- **Section C**: A triangle with base from 5 s to 8 s and height $(50 - 30)=20$ m\/s. The area of this section is $3\\times30+\\frac{1}{2}\\times3\\times20 = 120m$.\nTherefore, the total displacement of the object is $30 + 90+120 = 240m$.\n\n**Acceleration - time relationship**:\nThe acceleration vs time graph can be obtained by calculating the slope of the velocity - time graph at each point.\n- **Section A**: The slope of the line is positive, which means the acceleration is positive. The acceleration is constant and can be calculated as the change in velocity divided by the change in time: $\\frac{30 - 0}{2 - 0}=15\\frac{m}{s^{2}}$.\n- **Section B**: The slope of the line is 0, which means the acceleration is 0 m\/s\u00b2.\n- **Section C**: The slope of the line is positive, which means the acceleration is positive. The acceleration is constant and can be calculated as the change in velocity divided by the change in time: $\\frac{50 - 30}{8 - 5}=6.66\\frac{m}{s^{2}}$.\n\n**Answer**:\nTherefore, the acceleration vs time graph would be a piece - wise linear graph with a positive slope in section A, a horizontal line in section B, and again positive slope in section C. The slopes of the lines would be $15m\/s^{2}$ and $6.66m\/s^{2}$ in sections A and C, respectively.",

    "answer":"1. **Step 1: Given data and lens - formula introduction**\n   - Given: $s = 11cm$, $f= + 5cm$\n   - The lens formula is $\\frac{1}{v}-\\frac{1}{u}=\\frac{1}{f}$, where $v$ is the image - distance from the pole, $u$ is the object - distance from the pole, and $f$ is the focal distance.\n2. **Step 2: Applying the lens formula for the first case ($u=-11cm$)**\n   - Substitute $u = - 11cm$ and $f = 5cm$ into the lens formula $\\frac{1}{v}-\\frac{1}{u}=\\frac{1}{f}$, we get $\\frac{1}{v}-\\frac{1}{-11}=\\frac{1}{5}$.\n   - Then $\\frac{1}{v}=\\frac{1}{5}-\\frac{1}{11}$.\n   - Calculate $\\frac{1}{5}-\\frac{1}{11}=\\frac{11 - 5}{55}=\\frac{6}{55}$, so $v=\\frac{55}{6}\\approx9.17cm$.\n   - The magnification $m=\\frac{v}{u}$, substituting $v = 9.17cm$ and $u=-11cm$, we have $m=\\frac{9.17}{-11}\\approx - 0.83$.

    "answer":"**Step 1**\nEl problema consiste en deducir expresiones simb\u00f3licas para los puntos P y P'.\nPara resolver este problema, debemos tener en cuenta las siguientes consideraciones:\n- Puesto que ambas cargas son positivas, sabemos que se repelen entre s\u00ed. La ley de Coulomb establece que las cargas iguales se repelen.\n- Sabemos que la fuerza resultante depende de la magnitud de las cargas y de la distancia entre ellas.\n- Para calcular el campo el\u00e9ctrico en un punto del espacio, se utiliza la f\u00f3rmula $E = k\\times\\frac{q}{r^{2}}$, donde $k = 9\\times10^{9}\\ N\\times\\frac{m^{2}}{C^{2}}$ es la constante el\u00e9ctrica y $r$ es la distancia.\n- Dicha f\u00f3rmula calcula el m\u00f3dulo del campo el\u00e9ctrico en un punto del espacio, ubicado a la distancia $r$. Es importante mencionar que los vectores de campo el\u00e9ctrico poseen componentes en los ejes $X$ y $Y$ (como campo el\u00e9ctrico es un vector).\n- El campo el\u00e9ctrico total ser\u00e1 la suma (o resta) de los campos el\u00e9ctricos que cada part\u00edcula genera en $P$ y $P'$.\n\nExplanation:\nLa estrategia para resolver este problema consiste en encontrar el campo el\u00e9ctrico que genera cada part\u00edcula, y sumarlos para obtener el campo total en cada punto. Tambi\u00e9n ser\u00e1 necesario incluir la direcci\u00f3n. Es \u00fatil hacer un diagrama donde se observe el campo el\u00e9ctrico que cada carga genera.\n\n**Step 2**\nEn primer lugar, dibujemos un diagrama sencillo de los vectores de campo el\u00e9ctrico.\n\nEn este diagrama simplificado, se puede observar que el vector de campo el\u00e9ctrico generado por la carga $q_1$ en el punto $P$ es colineal a dicha carga, y como apunta hacia la izquierda, su componente en el eje $Y$ es 0.\nLo mismo ocurre con el vector de campo el\u00e9ctrico $\\vec{E}_{q2}$ que la carga $q_2$ genera en $P$. Los \u00e1ngulos que forman estos vectores con el eje $Y$ son de $0^{\\circ}$ y $180^{\\circ}$ respectivamente, y por tanto no poseen componente en el eje $Y$.\n\nExplanation:\nEl hecho de que existan 2 vectores de campo el\u00e9ctrico que no tienen componente en el eje $Y$ simplifica el trabajo, puesto que sus expresiones solo contendr\u00e1n componentes en el eje $X$. Puesto que el coseno del \u00e1ngulo $0^{\\circ}$ y $180^{\\circ}$ poseen valores bien - conocidos ($\\cos(0^{\\circ}) = 1$ y $\\cos(180^{\\circ})=- 1$), entonces el campo el\u00e9ctrico con componentes solo en el eje $X$ es m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil de expresar.\n\n**Step 3**\nAhora, el vector campo el\u00e9ctrico $\\vec{E}_{q1}$ forma un \u00e1ngulo de $45^{\\circ}$ con los ejes $X$ y $Y$ (los \u00e1ngulos del tri\u00e1ngulo son de $45 - 45-90$) y por lo tanto se puede expresar de la siguiente manera:\n$\\vec{E}_{q1}=k\\times\\frac{q_1}{r^{2}}\\times(\\cos(45^{\\circ})\\vec{i}+\\sin(45^{\\circ})\\vec{j})$\nEn donde $\\vec{i}$ y $\\vec{j}$ son vectores unitarios en las direcciones $X$ e $Y$ respectivamente.\nVale destacar que ya que el vector $\\vec{E}_{q1}$ apunta hacia arriba y hacia la izquierda, su componente $X$ es negativa. As\u00ed, podemos re - escribir la expresi\u00f3n de la siguiente manera:\n$\\vec{E}_{q1}=k\\times\\frac{q_1}{r^{2}}\\times(-\\cos(45^{\\circ})\\vec{i}+\\sin(45^{\\circ})\\vec{j})$\nAhora debemos plantear una expresi\u00f3n an\u00e1loga para $\\vec{E}_{q2}$. El vector campo el\u00e9ctrico $\\vec{E}_{q2}$ forma un \u00e1ngulo de $135^{\\circ}$ con el eje $X$ (o $45^{\\circ}$ con el eje $X$ negativo).\n$\\vec{E}_{q2}=k\\times\\frac{q_2}{r^{2}}\\times(-\\cos(45^{\\circ})\\vec{i}-\\sin(45^{\\circ})\\vec{j})$\nExplanation:\nRecordar que resolver una multiplicaci\u00f3n entre una magnitud escalar ($k\\times\\frac{q}{r^{2}}$) y un vector unitario ($\\vec{i}$ o $\\vec{j}$) otorga un vector con magnitud proporcional a la magnitud escalar y direcci\u00f3n del vector unitario. En este caso, estamos descomponiendo el vector de campo el\u00e9ctrico en componentes $X$ e $Y$.\n\n**Step 4**\nPor \u00faltimo, resta sumar las expresiones de $\\vec{E}_{q1}$ y $\\vec{E}_{q2}$ para obtener el campo el\u00e9ctrico total en el punto $P$ y de manera an\u00e1loga para el campo el\u00e9ctrico en $P'$.\n\n$\\vec{E}_{P}=\\vec{E}_{q1}+\\vec{E}_{q2}$\n$\\vec{E}_{P}=(k\\times\\frac{q_1}{r^{2}}\\times(\\cos(0^{\\circ})\\vec{i}+\\sin(0^{\\circ})\\vec{j}))+(k\\times\\frac{q_2}{r^{2}}\\times(-\\cos(0^{\\circ})\\vec{i}+\\sin(0^{\\circ})\\vec{j}))$\n\nY de manera an\u00e1loga para $P'$:\n$\\vec{E}_{P'}=\\vec{E}_{q1}'+\\vec{E}_{q2}'$\n$\\vec{E}_{P'}=(k\\times\\frac{q_1}{r^{2}}\\times(-\\cos(45^{\\circ})\\vec{i}-\\sin(45^{\\circ})\\vec{j}))+(k\\times\\frac{q_2}{r^{2}}\\times(-\\cos(45^{\\circ})\\vec{i}-\\sin(45^{\\circ})\\vec{j}))$\n\n**Answer**\nLas expresiones para campo el\u00e9ctrico neto en $P$ y $P'$ son las siguientes:\n- $\\vec{E}_{P}=(k\\times\\frac{q_1}{r^{2}}\\times(\\cos(0^{\\circ})\\vec{i}+\\sin(0^{\\circ})\\vec{j}))+(k\\times\\frac{q_2}{r^{2}}\\times(-\\cos(0^{\\circ})\\vec{i}+\\sin(0^{\\circ})\\vec{j}))$\n- $\\vec{E}_{P'}=(k\\times\\frac{q_1}{r^{2}}\\times(-\\cos(45^{\\circ})\\vec{i}-\\sin(45^{\\circ})\\vec{j}))+(k\\times\\frac{q_2}{r^{2}}\\times(-\\cos(45^{\\circ})\\vec{i}-\\sin(45^{\\circ})\\vec{j}))$\n![](images\/139839740_ddbfa924df017127174a57555a0ef79408f082d5e7d6841d697dc59e4043d2b8.jpg)\n![](images\/139839740_e9556991c62b4c8369da6ec6e72f33b193d0fb7b1769002af37da39619d048e8.jpg)",

    "answer":"Given that:\nReading of voltmeter is $V = 5.9V$.\nReading of ammeter is $I = 2.5mA$.\n\n**Step 1**\n(a) Since resistance $R$ is in parallel with voltmeter, the potential difference across $R$ is $V = 5.9V$. As $R$ and ammeter are in series, the current in $R$ is $I = 2.5mA$.\nUsing the formula $R=\\frac{V}{I}$, we have:\n$$ \\begin{align*} R&=\\frac{5.9V}{2.5mA}\\\\ &=\\frac{5.9V}{2.5\\times 10^{- 3}A}\\\\ &=2.36\\times 10^{3}\\Omega\\\\ &=2.36k\\Omega \\end{align*} $$\nExplanation: From Ohm's law, the relationship among current $I$, potential - difference $V$ and resistance $R$ is $R = \\frac{V}{I}$.\n\n**Step 2**\n(b) Resistance $R$ and $3.0k\\Omega$ are in series, so the equivalent resistance $R_{e}=R + 3.0k\\Omega$.\n$$ \\begin{align*} R_{e}&=2.36k\\Omega+3.0k\\Omega\\\\ &=5.36k\\Omega \\end{align*} $$\nThe emf of the battery $E$ is given by $E = IR_{e}$.\n$$ \\begin{align*} E&=2.5mA\\times5.36k\\Omega\\\\ &=2.5\\times 10^{-3}A\\times5.36\\times 10^{3}\\Omega\\\\ &=13.4V \\end{align*} $$\n\n**Step 3**\n(c) Resistance $3.0k\\Omega$ is in series with ammeter, so the current in $3.0k\\Omega$ is $I = 2.5mA$.\nThe potential difference across $3.0k\\Omega$ is $V'=I\\times3k\\Omega$.\n$$ \\begin{align*} V'&=2.5mA\\times3.0k\\Omega\\\\ &=2.5\\times 10^{-3}A\\times3.0\\times 10^{3}\\Omega\\\\ &=7.5V \\end{align*} $$\n\n**Step 4**\n(d) Assumptions:\n1.

    "answer":"### Step 1\n**Explanation**:\nCurrent in a CR - circuit is given by, $I=\\frac{E}{R}e^{-\\frac{t}{RC}}$ where $R$ is the net resistance of the circuit.\nAt $t = 0s$, switch $S3$ is closed. $S1$ and $S2$ are opened. Since the capacitor is not connected to the battery, the voltage is zero. Hence, current $I = 0$.\n\n### Step 2\n**Given**:\nAt time $t=t_1$, switch $S1$ and $S3$ are closed, and the students wait for a long time until the circuit reaches equilibrium.\n**Explanation**:\nWhen switches $S3$ and $S1$ are closed, the net resistance of the circuit is $R$. Therefore, current as a function of time $t$ is $I=\\frac{E}{R}e^{-\\frac{t}{RC}}$, and the graph is an exponentially - decreasing graph.\nThe graph of the function has the current $I$ on the y - axis and time $t$ on the x - axis, and the curve is $I=\\frac{E}{R}e^{-\\frac{t}{RC}}$.\n\n### Step 3\n**Given**:\nAt time $t = t_2$, $S1$ is opened, and $S2$ is closed simultaneously. $S3$ remains closed.\n**Explanation**:\nOnce $S1$ is opened, there is no more charging of the capacitor. The capacitor is already fully charged. When $S2$ is closed, the net resistance of the circuit, $R + R=2R$. So the net resistance of the circuit is increased. Since the capacitor is charged, it will discharge now, through the $2R$ resistance, and charge to its opposite terminals. There is a re - charging of the capacitor with opposite terminals taking place. But this time the maximum current reached is $E\/2R$ and current as a function of time $t$ is, $I=\\frac{E}{2R}e^{-\\frac{t}{2RC}}$. The re - charging of the capacitor graph has current $I$ on the y - axis and time $t$ on the x - axis, and the curve is $I=\\frac{E}{2R}e^{-\\frac{t}{2RC}}$.\n\n**Answer**:\nThe graphs are given above......\n![](images\/128882582_05f7b757860df2f091192f77c0267c720c531abbf5eef6ae86c28b983465b439.jpg)\n![](images\/128882582_b20873574cb5a207032fb19fa9ef70595385f199dc36fb0d2c67fd72d1b462f2.jpg)",

    "answer":"Step 1\n\nQuestion 4:\nAnalysis: Each fit equation indicated on the provided image refers to a specific fitted model for the data, be it linear, polynomial, logarithmic, or exponential decay. These equations such as can describe the following trends:\n- Linear fit refers to a straight - line approximation with constant slope.\n- Quadratic fit captures the parabolic trend.\n- Logarithmic fit and exponential decay fit both capture non - linear trends and gradual change, or a saturation phenomenon.\n\nExplanation:\nSome of these models are less complex than others and for this reason some results will differ. The differences are RMSE and correlation, that is achieved from goodness of fit. They stem from the fact that these data may depend more on some mathematical models than others due to the physical phenomena that they represent.\n\nStep 2\n\nQuestion 5:\nAnalysis: RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) describes how far the predicted model is from the data:\n- Linear Fit RMSE : 2.763 m\n- Quadratic Fit RMSE : 2.192 m\n- Logarithmic Fit RMSE : 1.254 m\n- Exponential Fit RMSE : 1.810 m\n\nBest Fit: The logarithmic fit RMSE value is the lowest (1.254 m), meaning it is arguably the best fit for the data trend. Almost as Good: The exponential fit (RMSE = 1.810 m) is near, though not exactly as good. The difference in RMSE shows that the logarithmic model is better, but only slightly.\n\nExplanation:\nThe RMSE depicts the average difference in values as compared to the averages and gives the distance of the given values from the central point in the set of values. The model with the lowest RMSE is said to fit better in comparison to other models. Using RMSE, we can determine which model, out of the several examined ones, fits the set of data best, however, those with close RMSE are said to perform similarly and those with larger differences are said to have a preferred model.\n\nStep 3\n\nQuestion 6:\nThe data shows a car speeding up and then gradually slowing down, the Exponential Fit is likely the most correct. This is because:\nExponential decay behavior: The acceleration and deceleration of cars is largely exponential for a whole range of reasons, such as drag forces or braking.\nRMSE Validity: It is accepted that RMSE validity ratio provides the most accurate result, therefore this car acceleration scenario provides the optimal approach.\nNevertheless, the Quadratic Fit may also describe the system because:\nParabolic trajectories: Quadratic fits are very common for describing motion that is uniformly accelerated.\nConceptual Simplicity: The two words summary, acceleration and deceleration gives sufficient indication of what is happening in the system under consideration.\n\nExplanation:\nAlternative Consideration: In the case where the system is more influenced by other forces, such as friction and air resistance the Exponential Fit is more realistic. Else in more simple cases where these assumptions are not taken into account, the Quadratic Fit would be acceptable.\n\nAnswer\n\nConclusion:\nThe Exponential Fit stands out as the best model due to its lowest RMSE value (1.810 m), and it describes well the physics of a car acceleration wit gradual deceleration as it comes to a halt along with realistic braking and drag forces. The Quadratic Fit seems to be a fair alternative but is much simpler at a cost of accuracy.",

A cyclotron consists of two hollow metal electrodes that are each shaped like the letter D. The Ds are placed in a vacuum and an external magnetic field is added. Charged particles are injected near the centre of the Ds. An electric potential difference across the D - separation accelerates the charged particles.

This continues, and each time the charged particles travel faster and faster.\nOne particular cyclotron is shown below. In this cyclotron, the charged particles are protons, the magnetic field strength is $0.863\\ T$, the electric potential difference is $0.200\\ MV$, and the D - separation is $5.00\\ cm$.

    "answer":"**Solution**\n\n**Step 1**\nNow, let's analyze the problem and solve it as follows:\na) Calculation of the mass of the rods.\nMass of a rod is calculated as its linear density ($\\lambda$) multiplied by its length ($L = 4m$).\nNow for the first rod:\n$M_1=\\lambda_1L = 0.25\\frac{kg}{m}\\times4m = 1.0kg$\nNow for the second rod:\n$M_2=\\lambda_2L = 0.5\\times4m = 2.0kg$\nAnd for the third rod:\n$M_3=\\lambda_3L = 0.75\\times4m = 3.0kg$\n\n**Explanation**:\nA rod's linear density ($\\lambda$) and length ($L$) determines the mass of a rod. Linear density is the mass per unit length of the oscillating rod. This equation applies for a rod of even density which is essential for rod mass - determination.\n\n**Step 2**\nb) Moment of inertia of a 1 kg point - mass at $L = 4m$\nThe moment of inertia quantifies the amount of resistance an object offers to rotational movement about a given axis. A point - mass can be calculated using the following expression.\n$I=m\\times r^{2}$\n$I = 1\\times(4)^{2}=16kg\\cdot m^{2}$\n\n**Explanation**:\nTo identify in detail: $m$ is the mass, and $r$ refers to the perpendicular distance of mass from the axis of rotation. The greater the distance of the mass from the axis, the higher the values of moment of inertia. This is why rotating a mass with greater distance from the axis is rather difficult.\n\n**Step 3**\nc) Moment of inertia of each rod about an axis passing through its endpoint\nLet us examine a thin rod of uniform mass distribution about an axis parallel to its length and situated at one of its ends.\nThe moment of inertia of this rod is calculated employing integral calculus as follows:\n$I_{rod}=\\frac{1}{3}ML^{2}$\n$I_{rod1}=\\frac{1}{3}M_1L^{2}=\\frac{1}{3}\\times1.0\\times(4)^{2}=5.33kg\\cdot m^{2}$\n$I_{rod2}=\\frac{1}{3}M_2L^{2}=\\frac{1}{3}\\times2.0\\times(4)^{2}=10.67kg\\cdot m^{2}$\n$I_{rod3}=\\frac{1}{3}M_3L^{2}=\\frac{1}{3}\\times3.0\\times(4)^{2}=16.0kg\\cdot m^{2}$\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe formula presented above is obtained when all the small mass portions ($dm$) that compose the length of the rod are integrated, factoring in their distance from the rotational point, with each small mass section's distance measured separately from the rotational point. It indicates the mass - configuration of the rod in relation to its endpoint.\n\n**Step 4**\nd) Complete individual mass distribution of every arm.\nAn arm of a whirligig is made up of:\nA rod whose moment of inertia was computed in subsection c.\nA point - mass located at the extremity of the rod which was computed in subsection b.\nThe moment of inertia of an arm is the total contribution of all the single parts of the arm:\n$I_{arm}=I_{rod}+I_{point - mass}$\n$I_{arm1}=I_{rod1}+I_{point - mass}=5.33 + 16=21.33kg\\cdot m^{2}$\n$I_{arm2}=I_{rod2}+I_{point - mass}=10.67 + 16=26.67kg\\cdot m^{2}$\n$I_{arm3}=I_{rod3}+I_{point - mass}=16.0 + 16=32.0kg\\cdot m^{2}$\n\n**Explanation**:\nThis illustrates the super - position principle of inertia for rotational motion. It states that any system's mass moment of inertia is the sum of all parts it is made of.\n\n**Step 5**\ne) Total moment of inertia of the whirligig\nThe total moment of the whirligig is the cumulative of the moments of inertia of all the three arms. Taking into account that each arm contributes separately to the system's rotation inertia, the moment of inertia can be computed as follows:\n$I_{total}=I_{arm1}+I_{arm2}+I_{arm3}$\n$I_{total}=21.33 + 26.67+32.0 = 80.0kg\\cdot m^{2}$\n\n**Explanation**:\nThis simple example demonstrates the impact of mass distribution and structure geometry on the resistance to rotational movement of the whirligigs.\n\n**Answer**\nThe whirligig's moment of inertia is determined by evaluating the contribution due to the rods and the point - masses located at their ends. By finding the individual moment of inertia for each arm and adding them together, we find the total moment of inertia which defines rotational inertia of the system. This procedure illustrates how mass and geometry affect the behavior of object while rotating.",

    "answer":"**Step 1: Explanation**\nForce between two charges is given by Coulomb's law, which states that if there are two charges $q$ and $Q$ placed at a distance of $R$ then force acting between them is given as $F=\\frac{qQ}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0R^{2}}$.\nIf the charges are opposite in nature (like one is positive - charge and the other is negative - charge or vice - versa) then force between them will be attractive, otherwise if charges will be of same nature then force will be repulsive in nature.\nHere we have to evaluate force on charge $Q$ due to charge $q$ placed at every corners. Since magnitude of charges are same hence the magnitude of the forces will also remain same.\nNow let's solve one by one for each setup:\n[Diagram shows a square with charges $+q$ at top - left, bottom - left, bottom - right and $-q$ at top - right, and a $-Q$ charge at the center.

    "answer":"### Step 1\n**Explanation**:\nTo determine the magnitude of the velocity by using the formula for linear in circular motion, $v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}$.\n$v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}$\nwhere;\n- $v$ is the linear velocity.\n- $r$ is the radius of the circle\n- $T$ is the time - period of one revolution.\n**Given**:\n$T = 0.4s$\n$r = 1.2m$\n$v=\\frac{2\\times\\pi\\times1.2}{0.4}$\n$v = 6\\pi$\n$v = 18.85\\frac{m}{s}$\nSo, the magnitude of the velocity is approximately $18.85\\frac{m}{s}$\n\n### Step 2\n**Explanation**:\nTo construct the vector $\\Delta\\vec{V}_0$ by graphically subtracting the corresponding arrows, then plot $\\Delta\\vec{V}_0$ with its tail on the ball at position. Now, address each statement.\n(a). The acceleration $\\vec{a}_0$ points in the same direction as $\\vec{V}_0$.\n\n**Answer**: True. If the velocity is constant, there is no acceleration, and both velocity and acceleration vectors point in the same direction as $\\vec{V}_0$.\n(b).

The velocity changes as the ball moves around the circle, so it's not constant.\n(c). $\\Delta\\vec{V}_0$ points in the same direction as $\\vec{V}_0$.\n**Answer**: True. $\\Delta\\vec{V}_0$ represents the average change in velocity from position - 1 to position 1. Since the motion is symmetric about the top of the circle, the average change in velocity should be pointing in the same direction as the velocity at position $\\vec{V}_0$.\n(d). $\\Delta\\vec{V}_0$ points towards the center of the circle.\n**Answer**: True.

    "answer":"Step 1\n\nPart (a): Compute the velocity and position functions for the rocket throughout all times when $t\\geq0$.\nGiven:\nExplanation:\n- Acceleration $a(t)=\\beta t$, where $\\beta = 18.00\\ m\/s^{3}$\n- Initial height $H = 2.00\\ m$\n- Initial velocity $v(0)=0$\n\nStep 1: To determine the velocity expression $v(t)$:\nThe relationship between acceleration and velocity is:\n- $a(t)=\\frac{dv}{dt}$\nIntegrating $a(t)$ with respect to $t$:\n- $v(t)=\\int a(t)dt=\\int\\beta tdt=\\frac{\\beta t^{2}}{2}+C_{1}$\nUsing the initial condition $v(0) = 0$:\n- $C_{1}=0$\nThus:\n- Substitute $\\beta = 18.00\\ m\/s^{3}$:\n- $v(t)=9.00t^{2}\\ m\/s$\n\nStep 2: Step 2: To get $y(t)$ position find the next step.\nThe following equation connects velocity and position:\n- $v(t)=\\frac{dy}{dt}$\nSubstituting $v(t)=9.00t^{2}$ with respect to $t$:\n- $y(t)=\\int v(t)dt=\\int9.00t^{2}dt = 3.00t^{3}+C_{2}$\nUsing the initial condition $y(0)=2.00\\ m$:\n- $C_{2}=2.00$\nThus:\n- $y(t)=3.00t^{3}+2.00\\ m$\n- Velocity and Position Summary:\n- $v(t)=9.00t^{2}\\ m\/s,\\ y(t)=3.00t^{3}+2.00\\ m$\n\nPart (b): What is the maximum altitude that the rocket will achieve?\n\nStep 1: Determine when My rocket uses up all its fuel?\nIt exhausts its supply after traveling $t = 5.00\\ s$ using $y(t)$ from Part (a):\n- $y(5.00)=3.00(5.00)^{3}+2.00=3.00(125.00)+2.00 = 377.00\\ m$\nOnce it reaches $5.00\\ s$ the rocket follows motion under just gravitational acceleration ($a=-g$)\n\nStep 2: Perform calculations to find rocket velocity when $t = 5.00$:\n- $v(5.00)=9.00(5.00)^{2}=9.00(25.00)=225.00\\ m\/s$\n\nStep 3: The additional height is found by solving kinematic equations with final velocity equal to zero.\nAfter $t = 5.00$, the rocket continues ascending until it achieves $v = 0$. Using $v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2a(y - y_{0})$:\n- $0=(225.00)^{2}+2(-9.81)(y - 377.00)$\nRearranging:\n- $y-377.00=\\frac{-(225.00)^{2}}{2(-9.81)}=\\frac{ - 50625}{-19.62}\\approx2580.73\\ m$\nThus, the maximum height is:\n- $y_{max}=377.00 + 2580.73=2957.73\\ m$\n\nStep 2\n\nPart (c): How long until the rocket returns to the ground?\n\nStep 1: We must calculate the total time it takes for the rocket to reach its maximum height.\nTime to reach $t = 5.00$:\n- $t_{1}=5.00\\ s$\nTime to stop upward motion after $t = 5.00$:\n- $t_{2}=\\frac{v_{0}}{g}=\\frac{225.00}{9.81}\\approx22.93\\ s$\nTotal time to reach the maximum height:\n- $t_{up}=t_{1}+t_{2}=5.00 + 22.93=27.93\\ s$\n\nStep 2: Calculate the time to return to the ground level for the falling rocket.\nUsing the height at the maximum point $y_{max}=2957.73\\ m$, use:\n- $y=\\frac{1}{2}gt^{2}$\nRearranging:\n- $t=\\sqrt{\\frac{2y}{g}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\times2957.73}{9.81}}\\approx24.51\\ s$\n\nStep 3: Total time:\n- $t_{total}=t_{up}+t_{down}=27.93+24.51 = 52.44\\ s$\n\nPart (d): The minimum acceptable launch height $H$ should be such that the rocket cannot hit the ground before 5 seconds.\nIn order to achieve a safe launch, the launch height $H$ must shield the rocket against gravitational pull impact with the ground before $t = 5.00$.\n\nStep 1: Find rocket position at $t = 5.00$:\nA rocket's launch cannot be maintained safely above 0 height at time $t = 5.00$ if $H$ remains too low. At $t = 5.00$:\n- $y(5.00)=3.00(5.00)^{3}+H$\nFor safety, $y(5.00)>0$\n- $3.00(125.00)+H>0\\Rightarrow375.00 + H>0$\nThus:\n- $H>- 375.00\\ m$\nSince each positive $H$ value satisfies the condition required for that, then, since $H$ cannot be negative:\n- $H_{min}=0\\ m$\n\nAnswer\n\nFinal Answers:\n1. $v(t)=9.00t^{2}\\ m\/s,\\ y(t)=3.00t^{3}+2.00\\ m$\n2. Maximum height: $2957.73\\ m$\n3. Total time to return to the ground: $52.44\\ s$\n4. Minimum height for safe launch: $0\\ m$",

Resistors Ra and Rb represent resistance that is actually distributed over 0.25 meter (the length of the vertical wires). Each of the wires can be made of different resistive material.\nWe want to design the defroster so that the glass heats up as uniformly as possible. Specifically, the design specification is to have a uniform power dissipation of 10 W\/meter along all of the defroster wires. That is, resistors R1 through R3 should each dissipate (10W\/m)\u00d7(1.5m) = 15W and resistors Ra and Rb should each dissipate (10W\/m)\u00d7(0.25m) = 2.5W.

The voltage drop across each vertical resistor ($R_a$, $R_b$) is the same.\nThe total supply voltage is $V_{dc}=12V$.\n\nStep 4: Voltage Distribution\n1. Horizontal resistors $R_1$, $R_2$, $R_3$ are in series, and they share the same current. The voltage across each horizontal resistor is:\n$$ V_{horizontal}=\\frac{12}{3}=4V $$\n2. Vertical resistors $R_a$ and $R_b$ form two parallel branches. Each vertical branch experiences a voltage drop of:\n$$ V_{vertical}=4V $$\n\nStep 5: Determine Resistances\n\nUsing the power formula $P = \\frac{V^2}{R}$, solve for $R$:\n1. For $R_1$, $R_2$, $R_3$:\n$$ R=\\frac{V^2}{P}=\\frac{4^2}{15}=\\frac{16}{15}\\approx1.07\\Omega $$\n2.

    "answer":"**\n**Lloyd's mirror**:\nIt is an apparatus that shows how Lloyd's single mirror can produce fringes due to interference and calculate the wavelength of monochromatic light. Laser light when reflected at the mirror forms a virtual image of the source and interference pattern formed because of the interference between the direct and the reflected light. Lloyd's Mirror is used to produce two - source interference pattern that have important differences from the interference pattern seen in Young's experiment.\n\n**Applications**:\n1. Optical measurement\n2. Underwater acoustics\n3. Radio astronomy\n\n**Interference**:\nInterference occurs when two or more waves overlap and combine to form a new wave pattern. This can result in regions of increased amplitude (constructive interference) or decreased amplitude (destructive interference).\n\n**Constructive interference**:\nWhen two waves travel in the same direction and are in phase with each other their amplitude gets added and the resultant wave is obtained.\n\n**Destructive interference**:\nWhen waves come together so that they completely cancel each other out. When two waves destructively interfere, they must have the same amplitude in opposite directions.\n\n**Explanation**:\nUnderstanding the basic principle of Lloyd's mirror, what is interference and its types.\n\n**Step 2**\n**Given**:\n$\\lambda_0 = 510\\ nm=510\\times10^{- 9}\\ m$ (wavelength of light)\n$d = 0.12\\ mm = 0.12\\times10^{-3}\\ m$ (distance above the mirror)\n$L = 1\\ m$ (distance from the source to the screen)\n\nFor constructive interference, the path - difference must be an integer multiple of the wavelength:\nThe path difference ($\\Delta$) between the direct light from point source and the light reflected from the mirror is given by:\n$\\Delta=2d-\\lambda_0$\n\nAs there is a $\\pi$ phase shift upon reflection, the condition for constructive interference becomes:\n$\\Delta = m\\lambda_0$\nwhere,\n$m = 1$ (for first maximum)\n\nFrom above we get,\n$2d-\\lambda_0=m\\lambda_0$\nputting the value of $m = 1$\n$2d-\\lambda_0=1\\times\\lambda_0$\nMultiply $\\lambda_0$ by 1.\n$2d-\\lambda_0=\\lambda_0$\nMove all terms not containing $d$ to the right side of the equation.\n$2d = 2\\lambda_0$\nDivide each term in $2d = 2\\lambda_0$ by 2 and simplify.\n$d=\\lambda_0$\n\nSince this situation yields a contradiction, we need to express the position of the maximum in terms of the geometry of the setup.\n\n**Explanation**:\nTo determine the position of the first interference maximum above the mirror, we can use the conditions for constructive interference.\n\n**Step 3**\nThe distance ($y$) of the first maximum above the mirror can be calculated using the small - angle approximation:\n$y=\\frac{m\\lambda_0L}{2d}$\nputting the values,\n$\\lambda_0 = 510\\ nm = 510\\times10^{-9}\\ m$\n$d = 0.12\\ mm = 0.12\\times10^{-3}\\ m$\n$m = 1$ (for first maximum)\n$L = 1\\ m$\n\n$y=\\frac{1\\times510\\times10^{-9}\\ m\\times1\\ m}{2\\times0.12\\times10^{-3}\\ m}$\nRemove parentheses.\n$y=\\frac{510\\times10^{-9}\\times1}{2\\times0.12\\times10^{-3}}$\nSimplify $\\frac{510\\times10^{-9}\\times1}{2\\times0.12\\times10^{-3}}$\n$y = 2.125\\times10^{-3}$\n\nThe result can be shown in multiple forms.\n**Scientific Notation**:\n$y = 2.125\\times10^{-3}$\n$y = 2.125\\times10^{- 6}\\ km$\n$y = 2.125\\ mm$\n\n**Explanation**:\nWe calculated the position of first interference maximum using the small - angle approximation.\n\n**Answer**\nPosition of the first interference maximum above the mirror is:\n$y = 2.125\\ mm$",

    "answer":"**Solution**:\nTo solve these questions, we will use concepts from electrostatics.\na. What is the potential at point P, the centroid of the triangle?\nThe electric potential $V$ at a point due to a point - charge ($q$) is given by:\n$V=\\frac{kq}{r}$\nwhere $k = 8.99\\times10^{9}\\,N\\cdot\\frac{m^{2}}{C^{2}}$ is Coulomb's constant, ($q$) is the charge, and ($r$) is the distance from the charge to the point.\nSince the point $P$ is the centroid of the triangle, all charges are equidistant from $P$. We will calculate the potential at $P$ due to each charge and then sum these potentials.\nb. What is the electric potential energy stored in the 3 - charge system?\nThe electric potential energy ($U$) of a system of charges is given by:\n$U=\\frac{kq_1q_2}{r_{12}}+\\frac{kq_1q_3}{r_{13}}+\\frac{kq_2q_3}{r_{23}}$\nwhere $r_{ij}$ is the distance between charges ($q_i$) and ($q_j$).\nFor an isosceles triangle, ($r_{12}=a$), ($r_{13}=b$), and ($r_{23}=a$).\nc. How much work must an external agent do to exchange the positions of ($q_1$) and ($q_3$)?\nThe work done to exchange two charges is the change in the potential energy of the system due to the exchange. Since the potential energy depends on the product of the charges and their distances, if we exchange the positions of two charges, the distances between pairs of charges do not change, so the total potential energy of the system remains unchanged. Therefore, the work done by an external agent is zero.\nd. How much work must an external agent do to exchange the positions of ($q_1$) and ($q_2$)?\nSimilarly, when exchanging ($q_1$) and ($q_2$), the total potential energy remains unchanged, so the work done by an external agent would again be zero.\nHowever, to ensure clarity and correctness, let's perform the calculations step - by - step. Starting with part (a), calculating the potential at point $P$. Then, we'll calculate the stored electric potential energy for part (b), and re - confirm the work required for parts (c) and (d). Let's start with part (a).\nThe electric potential at point $P$, the centroid of the triangle, at a distance of $3.5$ cm from the base, is approximately $5,137,143$ volts.\n\n**Explanation**:\nIn part (a), we calculated the electric potential at point $P$ by adding together the potentials contributed by each of the three charges. Each charge contributes to the total potential at $P$ according to the formula $V = \\frac{kq}{r}$, where ($k$) is Coulomb's constant, ($q$) is the charge, and ($r$) is the distance from the charge to point $P$. Since $P$ is the centroid of the triangle, all charges are the same distance from $P$, simplifying our calculation. The sum of these potentials gives the total electric potential at $P$, which we found to be approximately $5,137,143$ volts.\nThis high value results from the significant magnitude of the charges and the relatively short distance from each charge to point $P$.\n\n**Step 2**:\nNow let's calculate the electric potential energy stored in the 3 - charge system for part (b).\nThe electric potential energy stored in the 3 - charge system is approximately $- 26.97\\,J$ (joules).\nFor parts (c) and (d), as previously explained, the work required to exchange the positions of any two charges in this system would theoretically be zero because the system's total potential energy doesn't change solely due to positional swaps between charges. However, this assumes an ideal scenario without considering any path - dependent forces or external fields. But let's clarify if this understanding remains valid under standard electrostatic assumptions.\nUnder standard electrostatic assumptions, the work required by an external agent to exchange the positions of two charges in the system does not change the system's electrostatic potential energy. Therefore:\nc. The work required to exchange the positions of ($q_1$) and ($q_3$) is zero, because the total electrostatic potential energy of the system before and after the exchange remains the same.\nd. Similarly, the work required to exchange the positions of ($q_1$) and ($q_2$) is also zero for the same reason.\nIn electrostatics, the work done in moving charges around is stored as potential energy only if it results in a change in the system's total potential energy.\n\n**Explanation**:\nIn part (b), we calculated the electric potential energy of the three - charge system using the formula that combines the products of each pair of charges divided by their distances. The negative value indicates that there is an attractive interaction between some of the charges.\nFor parts (c) and (d), the theoretical work required to exchange positions of any two change is zero because this operation does not change the overall configuration's distances between charges, hence no change in the system's total electrostatic potential energy. This means that, under ideal conditions without external forces, moving charges around in such a manner does not require energy as long as it does not alter the system's total potential energy.\n\n**Answer**:\n**Final answer**:\nIn summary, for the electrostatic problems discussed:\n- The electric potential at point $P$, the centroid of the triangle, due to the three charges is calculated to be approximately $5,137,143$ volts, based on the principle that potential is additive and independent of the sign of the charges.\n- The total electric potential energy stored within the system of three charges is approximately $-26.97\\,J$, which results from the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.\n- The work required to exchange positions of any two charges (either ($q_1$) with ($q_3$) or ($q_1$) with ($q_2$)) is zero under electrostatic assumptions, as such exchanges do not alter the system's total potential energy.",

    "answer":"**Step 1**\n(a) Electron Drift Velocity and Hall Current Density\n1. Electron Motion:\nThe electrons within the plasma experience two forces:\nElectric force: $\\mathbf{F_e}=-e\\mathbf{E}$ (course along $\\mathbf{E}$, down - wards)\nMagnetic force: $\\mathbf{F_m}=-e\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}$ (perpendicular to both $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$, because of proper - hand rule)\nSince there may be no net pressure on the electrons inside the steady country, we will write:\n$\\mathbf{F_e}+\\mathbf{F_m}=0$\n$-e\\mathbf{E}+(-e\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}) = 0$\n2. Solving for Drift Velocity:\n$-e(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}) = 0$\n$\\mathbf{v}=-\\frac{\\mathbf{E}}{\\mathbf{B}}$\nHowever, the electron speed is not truly alongside $\\mathbf{E}$ however additionally has a aspect due to the magnetic discipline.\nExplanation:\nThis thing is perpendicular to $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$, ensuing in a waft speed inside the axial direction. To account for this, we observe that the magnetic force also reasons the electrons to curl across the cylinder.\nThis curling movement does no longer affect the net pressure, but it does contribute to the drift velocity.\nTherefore, the flow speed is: $\\mathbf{v_{drift}}=\\frac{\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^{2}}$\n\n**Step 2**\n3. Hall Current Density:\nThe Hall modern - day density is the cutting - edge carried via the drifting electrons. Since the electrons have a negative price, the present day density is:\n$\\mathbf{j_{Hall}}=-n_e e\\mathbf{v_{drift}}=-n_e e\\frac{\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^{2}}$\nExplanation:\nTherefore, the electrons flow at a regular velocity $\\mathbf{v_{drift}}=\\frac{\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^{2}}$, and this float creates a Hall current density $\\mathbf{j_{Hall}}=-n_e e\\frac{\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^{2}}$.\n\n**Step 3**\n(b) Net Thrust and Lorentz Force on Ions\n1. Net Thrust:\nThe Lorentz force acting on a shifting charge in a magnetic discipline is given with the aid of $\\mathbf{F}=q\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}$. In this situation, the ions are transferring in the radial path (because of the electric field) and revel in a Lorentz force in the azimuthal course.\nSince the ions are ejected from the cylinder, the Lorentz pressure on them creates a internet force, which in keeping with Newton's 3rd law, exerts an identical and opposite pressure on the cylinder walls, resulting in a thrust in the contrary route (axial course).\nThis thrust can be calculated via integrating the Lorentz pressure over the cylindrical surfaces and contemplating the present day density and magnetic area distribution. The result is:\n$\\mathbf{T}=\\mathbf{B}\\times\\mathbf{j_{Hall}}$\nTherefore, the cylindrical shells enjoy a internet thrust because of the interaction between the Hall modern and the magnetic field.\nExplanation:\n2. Lorentz Force on Ions:\nThe Lorentz pressure also acts on the ions, however it does not without delay make a contribution to the thrust. Since the ions are ejected radially, the Lorentz pressure does now not change their net momentum within the axial route. However, it does have an effect on the trajectory of the ions, inflicting them to spiral around the cylinder axis as they're ejected.\n\n**Answer**\nTherefore,\nElectrons drift in the axial route with a consistent speed $\\mathbf{v_{drift}}=\\frac{\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^{2}}$.\nThis go with the flow creates a Hall modern density $\\mathbf{j_{Hall}}=-n_e e\\frac{\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}}{B^{2}}$.\nThe Hall current and the magnetic area have interaction to create a net thrust $\\mathbf{T}=\\mathbf{B}\\times\\mathbf{j_{Hall}}$ at the cylindrical shells.\nThe Lorentz force acts at the ions however does not directly contribute to the thrust. It impacts their trajectory but no longer their internet axial momentum.",

    "answer":"**Step 1**\nIntroduction: Two blocks, connected by a mass - less rope over a frictionless pulley, are released. Block 1 (mass ($M_1$)) sits on a frictionless table, while Block 2 (mass ($M_2$)) hangs vertically. Determine the relationship between the tension in the rope and the weights of the blocks.\nExplanation: The resistive force that prevents two surfaces in contact from moving is known as friction. It depends on the characteristics of the surfaces and their relative motion and acts parallel to the surface.\n\n**Step 2**\nSolution:\nTwo blocks are connected by a rope and are free to move, with Block 1 on a frictionless surface and Block 2 hanging vertically. Since Block 2 is hanging and Block 1 is able to move, the system will accelerate due to the gravitational force acting on Block 2.\n1. This is not true. If the system is accelerating, the tension in the rope must be less than the weight of Block 2 because the net force on Block 2 is what causes it to accelerate.\n2. This is not true. The tension cannot be greater than the weight of Block 2 because Block 2 would then accelerate upward, which doesn't match the setup.\n3. This is true. Block 2 is accelerating downward, meaning the tension is less than the weight of Block 2.\n4. This is not true. Since Block 1 is on a frictionless table and the system is accelerating, the tension is related to the force required to accelerate Block 1, which is less than its weight (since the weight of Block 1 doesn't directly contribute to horizontal motion).\n5. This is not true. The tension only causes horizontal motion for Block 1, and the weight of Block 1 doesn't play a direct role in this motion because of the frictionless surface.\n6. This is true. The tension accelerates Block 1 horizontally, but Block 1\u2019s weight (which acts vertically) doesn't directly affect this tension.\n7. This is not true. The tension will always be less than the weight of Block 2, regardless of which block has a larger mass. The acceleration and tension are determined by the system\u2019s dynamics, not just which block is heavier.\nExplanation: When forces operating from opposite ends pull a string, rope, or cable taut, tension is the pulling force communicated through the material, usually throughout its length.\n\n**Answer**\nConclusion:\nCorrect Statements is,\nThe tension is less than the weight of Block 2.\nThe tension is less than the weight of Block 1.",

The position does not change.\nThird Quarter (Decline): The individual returns to the reference point, slowing down as the slope declines.\nExplanation:\nIn this step we can describe the Motion in Each Segment. Here the graph shows movement away from the origin stopping briefly and then returning toward the starting point.\n\n**Step 2**\n2: Important Observations Regarding the Motion\nInitial Position: The story starts at position 0 (the reference point).\nFinal Position: The individual ends up back at the starting position (position 0).\nWhen They Stop: In the flat part of the curve, the individual stops to take a break..\nSpeed Comparison: The speed is constant both in the beginning and the last part of the piece; it was slower in the last part as suggested by the less steep slope.\nExplanation:\nIn this step we can make Important Observations Regarding the Motion.

    "answer":"**Solution**\n\n**Step 1**\n**Part (a)**\nIn position versus time graph, since the slope determines the velocity, so when the slope is constant for any period, then the velocity is constant in that period.\nFrom the graph we see that the slope is constant between A and B, B and C, C and D. So, the velocity is constant between the periods 0 s to 1 s, 1 s to 3 s and 3 s to 5 s.\n**Explanation**:\nIn a position vs time graph, the slope determines the velocity and hence a constant slope means constant velocity.\n\n**Step 2**\n**Part (b)**\nThe instantaneous velocity is the slope of the tangent to the graph at the given time.\n**(i)**\nAt $t = 0.5\\ s$ the position is between A and B, therefore the velocity at $0.5\\ s$ is the slope at $0.5\\ s$.\nSince position at A and B is 2 cm and 2 cm respectively.\nThe time at A and B is 1 s and 0 s respectively.\nThe slope at $0.5\\ s$ is,\n$v=\\frac{\\Delta position}{\\Delta time}=\\frac{2 - 2}{1-0}$\n$\\Rightarrow v = 0\\frac{cm}{s}$\n\n**(ii)**\nAt $t = 2\\ s$ the position is between B and C, therefore the velocity at $2\\ s$ is the slope at 2 s.\nSince position at B and C is 2 cm and 8 cm respectively.\nThe time at B and C is 3 s and 1 s respectively.\nThe slope at 2 s is,\n$v=\\frac{\\Delta position}{\\Delta time}=\\frac{8 - 2}{1 - 3}$\n$\\Rightarrow v=3\\frac{cm}{s}$\n\n**(iii)**\nAt $t = 4\\ s$ the position is between C and D, therefore the velocity at 4 s is the slope at 4 s.\nSince position at C and D is 8 cm and 10 cm respectively.\nThe time at C and D is 3 s and 5 s respectively.\nThe slope at 4 s is,\n$v=\\frac{\\Delta position}{\\Delta time}=\\frac{10 - 8}{5 - 3}$\n$\\Rightarrow v = 1\\frac{cm}{s}$\n**Explanation**:\nThe slope of a line $y=mx + c$ is given by $\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$\n\n**Step 3**\n**Part (c)**\nThe average velocity is defined as the change in position by change in time, that is, $v=\\frac{\\Delta position}{\\Delta time}$\n**(i)**\nBetween A and C:\nThe position and time at A is 2 cm and 0 s.\nThe position and time at C is 8 cm and 3 s.\nNow the average velocity is,\n$v=\\frac{8 - 2}{3-0}$\n$\\Rightarrow v = 2\\frac{cm}{s}$\n\n**(ii)**\nBetween A and D:\nThe position and time at A is 2 cm and 0 s.\nThe position and time at D is 10 cm and 5 s.\nNow the average velocity is,\n$v=\\frac{10 - 2}{5-0}$\n$\\Rightarrow v = 1.6\\frac{cm}{s}$\n\n**(iii)**\nBetween B and D:\nThe position and time at B is 2 cm and 1 s.\nThe position and time at D is 10 cm and 5 s.\nNow the average velocity is,\n$v=\\frac{10 - 2}{5 - 1}$\n$\\Rightarrow v = 2\\frac{cm}{s}$\n**Explanation**:\nThese are the required average velocities.\n\n**Answer**\n**Final answer**:\n**Part (a)**\nThe velocity is constant between the periods 0 s to 1 s, 1 s to 3 s and 3 s to 5 s.\n**Part (b)**\n**(i)** The instantaneous velocity at $t = 0.5\\ s$ is $0\\frac{cm}{s}$.\n**(ii)** The instantaneous velocity at $t = 2\\ s$ is $3\\frac{cm}{s}$.\n**(iii)** The instantaneous velocity at $t = 4\\ s$ is $1\\frac{cm}{s}$.\n**Part (c)**\n**(i)** The average velocity between A and C is $2\\frac{cm}{s}$.\n**(ii)** The average velocity between A and D is $1.6\\frac{cm}{s}$.\n**(iii)** The average velocity between B and D is $2\\frac{cm}{s}$.",

    "answer":"** - **Introduction**\nThis problem is related to finding the net electric force on a charge of +e kept at the apex of an equilateral triangle where two negative charges lie at the base - corners. Coulomb's Law is used here whereby three charges and their magnitudes, in conjunction with the distances that separate them, determine the force between them. The length of a side of the triangle here is 5 cm, making punctuality quite valuable in simplifying our calculations.\nExplanation:\nEach negative charge on the equilateral - triangle perceives an attractive force to the positive charge. Since our geometry is of great importance, there is a horizontal and vertical component of these forces. The horizontal components being in opposite direction, their magnitudes act the same. This completely zeroes the force out in this direction, leaving only the vertical components to contribute to net force. By viewing components of the same forces and summing the vertical contribution, we will find the total force.\n\n**2nd step** - **Apply Coulomb's Law**\nThe electric force between two charges is given by:\n$F = k\\frac{\\vert q_1q_2\\vert}{r^{2}}$\nwhere:\n- $k = 8.99\\times10^{9}\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C^{2}}$ is Coulomb's constant,\n- $q_1,q_2$ are the magnitudes of the charges,\n- $r$ is the distance between the charges.\nFor the charges in this problem:\n- $q_1= + e=1.6\\times10^{-19}\\ C$\n- $q_2=-2e = - 3.2\\times10^{-19}\\ C$\n- $r = 5cm=0.05m$\nThe force between the positive charge +e and each negative charge - 2e is:\n$F = k\\frac{\\vert(+e)( - 2e)\\vert}{r^{2}}=\\frac{8.99\\times10^{9}\\cdot(1.6\\times10^{-19})\\cdot(3.2\\times10^{-19})}{(0.05)^{2}}$\nSimplify:\n$F=\\frac{8.99\\times10^{9}\\cdot5.12\\times10^{-38}}{0.0025}=\\frac{4.6\\times10^{-28}}{0.0025}=1.84\\times10^{-25}\\ N$\nEach negative charge exerts a force of $1.84\\times10^{-25}N$ on the positive charge.\n\n**Resolve Forces into Components**\n- The force between +e and the left - 2e charge acts along the line connecting these charges. This force can be resolved into:\n  - Horizontal component: $F_x = F\\cos(30^{\\circ})$\n  - Vertical component: $F_y = F\\sin(30^{\\circ})$\nSimilarly, the force from the right - 2e charge is resolved into:\n  - Horizontal component: $F_x = F\\cos(30^{\\circ})$\n  - Vertical component: $F_y = F\\sin(30^{\\circ})$\nUsing trigonometric values: $\\cos(30^{\\circ})=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, $\\sin(30^{\\circ})=\\frac{1}{2}$\nFor the left - 2e charge:\n$F_{x1}=1.84\\times10^{-25}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, $F_{y1}=1.84\\times10^{-25}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}$\nFor the right - 2e charge:\n$F_{x2}=1.84\\times10^{-25}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, $F_{y2}=1.84\\times10^{-25}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}$\n\n**Calculate Net Force**\n**Horizontal components (Fx):**\nThe horizontal components cancel each other because they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:\n$F_{net,x}=F_{x1}-F_{x2}=0$\n**Vertical components (Fy):**\nThe vertical components add up because they act in the same direction:\n$F_{net,y}=F_{y1}+F_{y2}$\nSubstituting values:\n$F_{net,y}=2\\cdot F\\cdot\\sin(30^{\\circ})=2\\cdot1.84\\times10^{-25}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}$\n$F_{net,y}=1.84\\times10^{-25}\\ N$\nThe net force is purely vertical, with a magnitude of $1.84\\times10^{-25}\\ N$.\n\n**Explanation**\nThe magnitude of the net force is calculated to be $1.84\\times10^{-25}\\ N$ purely in the vertical direction (downward). However, this symmetry stops the computation from becoming complex since it brings about the reduced multidimensional problem to only one effective force component.\n\n**Answer**\nThe final downward - vertical net force acted upon charge +e is $1.84\\times10^{-25}\\ N$. This illustrates the combined effect of several charges in a symmetric configuration and highlights that the vector components determine the net interactions.",

    "answer":"Step 1\nIntroduction\nThis problem consists in considering two masses tied up together by a rope that passes over a frictionless pulley. The first mass with weight 3m hangs vertically while the supporting block is also on a friction incline of 30 degrees; whose weight is still mg and that is where friction comes in with a coefficient of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$. The system is at rest, with the target of solving the velocity at which m1 will hit the ground when it falls from a height of 7m. The forces acting on the masses are gravity, tension, and friction. Their actions on the masses tell the system acceleration.\nExplanation:\nAs for the forces inside m2 along the incline, the gravitational pull on m2 is $W + f=0$, which means it plays no role in the net force itself. M1, on the other hand, is being driven by gravity, which accelerates the system. The acceleration is the result of the total mass of both objects. In turn, m2 is restricted by the incline, leaving m1's fall as a judgment criterion for the behavior of the overall system.\n\nStep 2\n1. Analyze the forces on the system:\n   - For $m1 = 3m$ (hanging mass):\n     - Downward force due to gravity: $Fg1=m1g = 3mg$.\n   - For $m2 = 2m$ (mass on the incline):\n     - Gravitational force along the incline: $F_{gravity, incline}=m2g\\sin\\theta=2mg\\sin(30^{\\circ})=mg$.\n     - Frictional force opposing motion: $F_{gravity, incline}=mg\\sin\\theta = 2mg\\sin(30^{\\circ})=mg$.\nThus, the net force on m2 is:\n$F_{net, incline}=mg - F_{friction}=mg - mg = 0$.\n2. Net force on the system:\nThe only net force causing acceleration is due to m1, as the forces on m2 cancel out.\nThe net force is:\n$F_{net}=F_{g1}-F_{friction}=3mg - mg = 2mg$.\n3. Acceleration of the system:\nThe total mass of the system is $m1 + m2=3m+2m = 5m$. Using Newton's second - law:\n$F_{net}=(m1 + m2)a\\Rightarrow2mg = 5ma$.\n$a=\\frac{2g}{5}$.\n4. Determine the final velocity:\nThe system starts from rest, so the initial velocity (u) is 0. The height of m1 is $h = 7m$.\nUsing the kinematic equation:\n$v^{2}=u^{2}+2as$,\nwhere $s = h = 7m$, $u = 0$, and $a=\\frac{2g}{5}$:\n$v^{2}=0 + 2\\cdot\\frac{2g}{5}\\cdot7$.\n$v^{2}=\\frac{28g}{5}$.\n$v=\\sqrt{\\frac{28g}{5}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{28\\cdot10}{5}}=\\sqrt{56}=2\\sqrt{14}$.\nExplanation:\nSo using the acceleration calculated before and the initial condition, the kinematics of the system can be employed to find the velocity of m1 just before hitting the ground. The falling object ensures that m2 displaces on the incline, keeping a constant relationship between the masses. Uniform acceleration equals a velocity that would be derived in terms of the distance fallen by m1.\n\nAnswer\nThe speed of the object of mass m1 just before hitting the ground is: $4\\sqrt{10}m\/s$.",

In its cavity, insulated from the conductor, is a small, isolated sphere with a charge of -5 nC.\nFind the charge on the outer surface of the hollow conductor for the case where the conductor has a net charge of +1 nC.\nFind the charge on the inner surface of the cavity for the case where the conductor has a net charge of +1 nC.\nThe diagram shows a spherical - shaped hollow conductor. The net charge of the conductor is +7 nC. Inside the cavity, there is a charge of -5 nC. On the cavity wall, there is a charge of +5 nC, and on the outer surface, there is a charge of +2 nC.

    "answer":"Step 1\nDetermine the charge on the outer surface of the hollow conductor when the conductor has a net charge of +1 nC.\nStep 1: Analyze the total charge of the conducting shell\nThe total charge of the conducting shell is given as +1 nC. This total charge is distributed between:\n1. The inner surface of the conductor (to cancel the electric field due to the charge inside the cavity).\n2. The outer surface of the conductor (to account for the net charge on the shell).\nStep 2: Use Gauss's Law for the cavity\nInside the cavity is a charge of -5 nC. The conductor must induce a charge on its inner surface such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. By Gauss's law, this induced charge must be:\n$Q_{inner}=-Q_{cavity}= + 5\\ nC$\nThis ensures that the total charge inside the Gaussian surface enclosing the cavity is zero.\nStep 3: Compute the charge on the outer surface\nThe total charge on the conductor is the sum of the charges on the inner and outer surfaces:\n$Q_{total}=Q_{inner}+Q_{outer}$\nSubstitute the known values:\n$1\\ nC = 5\\ nC+Q_{outer}$\nSolve for $Q_{outer}$:\n$Q_{outer}=1\\ nC - 5\\ nC=-4\\ nC$\nExplanation:\nThe electric field in the cavity is cancelled by the inner surface so the conductor ensures that. We see that the charge on the inner surface accounts for what remains of the charge +1 nC required by the entire charge of the conductor. As a result we have the outer - surface charges equal to -4 nC.\n\nStep 2\nDetermine the charge on the inner surface of the cavity when the conductor has a net charge of +1 nC.\nStep 1: Apply Gauss's Law inside the cavity\nInside the cavity is a negative charge of -5 nC. Therefore, it is required so that the inner surface of the conductor induces a charge inside the cavity, so that the charge inside the cavity and the charge induced on the inner surface of the conductor compensated each other, the amount of charge induced on the inner surface of the conductor is equal to the amount of charge inside the cavity. Using Gauss's law:\n$Q_{inner}=-Q_{cavity}= + 5\\ nC$\nExplanation:\nThis charge on the inner surface of the conductor neutralises the charge in the cavity. This assuages us that the electric field in the conductor is zero, which is to be so of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium.\n\nAnswer\nFinal answer:\n1. Charge on the outer surface: $Q_{outer}=-4\\ nC$\n2. Charge on the inner surface: $Q_{inner}= + 5\\ nC$",

    "answer":"**Step 1**\n- **Explanation**:\n    - This problem is solved using Newton's second - law on a mass subjected to a spring.\n    - The diagram of this exercise shows a mass $m$ attached to a spring. The mass block only moves horizontally. Consider this as the $x$ - axis. Two forces act on the mass block: an elastic force due to the spring and a damping force due to the medium in which the mass block moves. According to Newton's second - law, $ma_x=-kx - bv$, where the first term on the right - hand side is Hooke's law that models the force due to a spring and the second term is the damping force given in the statement.\n\n**Step 2**\n- **Explanation**:\n    - Write Newton's second - law as a differential equation.\n    - Since $a_x=\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}$ and $v = \\frac{dx}{dt}$, then $ma_x=-kx - bv$ can be rewritten as $m\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}+b\\frac{dx}{dt}+kx = 0$.

Applying the formula:\n$\\frac{1}{v}-\\frac{1}{u}=\\frac{1}{f}$\n$\\Rightarrow\\frac{1}{v}-\\frac{1}{- 85}=\\frac{1}{32}$\n$\\Rightarrow\\frac{1}{v}=\\frac{1}{32}-\\frac{1}{85}$\n$= 0.0194852$\n$\\Rightarrow v = 51.32$ cm\nExplanation:\nHere $u$ is the distance of candle from the lens $= 85$cm.\n\n**Step 3**\nFrom the ray - diagram, the Image - 1 due to the concave mirror is located at same position where the original candle is placed.\nWhen the object is placed in front of mirror at center of curvature, image will always form with the object but in inverted direction. It is happen due to radius of curvature is twice the focal length of the concave mirror i.e. $r = 2f'$\nExplanation:\nwhere $f'$ is the focal length of the concave mirror\n\n**Step 4**\nThe Image - 1 is behave like an virtual object to the lens and final image will form by the lens at the right side of the mirror.\nThe position of the virtual object is $u = 85$cm, so the final image also formed at 51.32~cm.\nExplanation\nApplying the formula $\\frac{1}{v}-\\frac{1}{u}=\\frac{1}{f}$, it will get same result as we previously done in step - (1).\nHere the value of $u$ must be $-85$cm because the image - 1 or the virtual object is left side of the mirror.\nThe final image must be a real image and erect with respect to the original object.\nThe final image is erect to the original image because the virtual image is already inverted so the final image is inverted to the virtual object,\nExplanation:\nso over all the final image is erect to the original object.\n\n**Answer**\nWhen the light directly passes through the lens, the image will form at 51.32 cm right to the lens.

It continuously changes and becomes minimum at the top - most point.\n\n**Step 2**\n\nLet's talk about the acceleration in this motion.\n\n**Explanation**:\n\nIn projectile motion, the acceleration of the projectile is due to the gravitational force acting vertically downward. Since there are no horizontal forces acting on the projectile (assuming no air resistance), the horizontal component of acceleration is zero. The vertical component of acceleration ($a_y$) is simply the acceleration due to gravity ($g$), which is approximately $9.81m\/s^2$ near the Earth's surface. The acceleration due to gravity causes the vertical velocity of the projectile to change continuously, accelerating it downward.\n\nTherefore, in projectile motion, the acceleration can be expressed as:\n$a_x = 0$\n$a_y=-g$\n\nWhere:\n- $a_x$ is the horizontal component of acceleration.\n- $a_y$ is the vertical component of acceleration.\n- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nHere there will be only vertical acceleration be present and it points in the downward direction at every point on the motion.\n\n**Answer**\n\nWe have drawn both the velocity vectors and the acceleration vectors at every point.\n![](images\/145339101_d241ee19847dc9773388d2dc5848ffe8b81087816f1f56f8a448316cb7f4895c.jpg)\n![](images\/145339101_bf2f5e859d4fa435bb7d83e57f240e3ed397e3f7ae8987f2e75918956d37d80e.jpg)",

    "answer":"Step 1\nLet $(\\sigma_1 = -\\eta)$ and $(\\sigma_2=-2\\eta)$.\nFormula Used:\nThe electric field due to a large sheet with surface charge density $(\\sigma)$ is:\n$$ E = \\frac{\\sigma}{2\\epsilon_0} $$\nwhere $(\\epsilon_0)$ is the permittivity of free space. The direction of the electric field depends on the sign of the surface charge density.\n\nAnalyze the contribution from each sheet\nSheet 1:\nSurface charge density is $(\\sigma_1 = -\\eta)$. The electric field due to this sheet is:\n$$ E_1=\\frac{-\\eta}{2\\epsilon_0} $$\nThe field points towards the negatively charged sheet.\n\nSheet 2:\nSurface charge density is $(\\sigma_2=-2\\eta)$. The electric field due to this sheet is:\n$$ E_2=\\frac{-2\\eta}{2\\epsilon_0}=\\frac{-\\eta}{\\epsilon_0} $$\nThe field also points towards this negatively charged sheet.\n\nExplanation:\nThe electric field due to each sheet is calculated using $(E = \\frac{\\sigma}{2\\epsilon_0})$. The directions are determined by the negative surface charge densities.\n\nStep 2\nSuperimpose the electric field at point $(P)$\nThe net electric field at $(P)$ is the vector sum of $(E_1)$ and $(E_2)$.\nDirection Analysis:\nPoint $(P)$ lies between the two sheets:\n1. The electric field due to $(\\sigma_1)$ points to the right (positive $(x)$ - direction).\n2. The electric field due to $(\\sigma_2)$ points to the left (negative $(x)$ - direction).\n\nThus, the net electric field is:\n$$ E_n=E_1 - E_2=\\frac{-\\eta}{2\\epsilon_0}-\\left(-\\frac{\\eta}{\\epsilon_0}\\right) $$\n\nExplanation:\nThe net electric field is found by superimposing contributions from both sheets, considering their directions. The field from $(\\sigma_1)$ points right; $(\\sigma_2)$ point left.\n\nStep 3\nSimplify the expression\n$$ E_n=\\frac{-\\eta}{2\\epsilon_0}+\\frac{\\eta}{\\epsilon_0}=\\frac{\\eta}{2\\epsilon_0} $$\n\nExplanation:\nSubstituting $(E_1)$ and $(E_2)$, the net field is simplified algebraically.

    "answer":"### Solution\n\n**Step 1**\nA spring is a device consisting of an elastic but largely rigid material bent or molded into a form that returns to its shape after being compressed or stretched.\n**Explanation**:\nStress is defined as the force acting per unit area.\n\n**Step 2**\nA) Free body diagram for the system:\nThe free - body diagram shows a block of mass $m$ on top of a block of mass $M$. There are two springs with spring constants $k_1$ and $k_2$ attached to the side of the block of mass $M$. The forces acting on the system are:\n- Normal forces $N_1$ and $N_2$ acting on the blocks in the vertical direction.\n- Gravitational forces $W_m = mg$ and $W_M=Mg$ acting downwards.\n- Spring forces $F_1=-k_1x$ and $F_2 = - k_2x$ acting horizontally.\n\n**Explanation**:\nFree - body diagrams are simplified representations in a problem of an object and the forces acting on it.\n\n**Step 3**\nB) Both springs are connected in parallel.

    "answer":"Step 1\nANSWER:\nVectors are mathematical quantities that have both magnitude and direction; thus, they are of paramount utility in physics and engineering. They can be interpreted in Cartesian form as unit vectors in the direction of the x and the y axes. Vector decomposition is the splitting up of a vector into horizontal and vertical components.\n\nExplanation:\nThe significance of vector decomposition is to ensure that individual components are aligned such that direct addition or subtraction becomes feasible. The resultant vector is then created by vectorial addition of those components, while its magnitude and direction are made apparent through the process of subtraction.\n\nStep 2\n1: Expressing Vectors in Cartesian Form\nEach given vector is decomposed into components.\n\nVector A\n- Given: A = 8.0 m, downward along the negative y - axis.\n- Components: $A_x=0$, $A_y = - 8.0$\n- Cartesian form: $\\mathbf{A}=0\\mathbf{i}-8.0\\mathbf{j}$\n\nExplanation:\nIn essence, the law of sines and the law of cosines are truly direct methods that allow an escape from component resolution in vector operations.\n\n2: Computing B + C\nUsing component - wise addition:\n$(B + C)_x=B_x + C_x=12.99+(-10.88)=2.11$\n$(B + C)_y=B_y + C_y=7.5+(-5.07)=2.43$\n\nMagnitude of B + C:\n$|B + C|=\\sqrt{(2.11)^2+(2.43)^2}=\\sqrt{4.45 + 5.90}=\\sqrt{10.35}=3.22$ m\n\nDirection:\n$\\theta=\\tan^{-1}(\\frac{2.43}{2.11})=\\tan^{-1}(1.15)=49.4^{\\circ}$\n\nExplanation:\nThe resultant vector is given by the sum of the individual components whose magnitude is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem and whose direction is calculated using the inverse tangent function.\n\n3: Alternative Method to Compute B + C\nInstead of using components, the resultant vector can be determined using:\n- Graphical method (tip - to - tail rule)\n- Law of Cosines and Law of Sines if the angle between B and C is known.\nUsing the Law of Cosines:\n$R=\\sqrt{B^{2}+C^{2}-2BC\\cos\\theta}$\nUsing the Law of Sines to find the direction:\n$\\frac{\\sin\\alpha}{C}=\\frac{\\sin\\beta}{B}=\\frac{\\sin\\gamma}{R}$\n\nExplanation:\nThere's no need for me to get into that tedious vector resolution into its Cartesian components using trigonometric functions since it is quite obvious.\n\nAnswer\nVectors in Cartesian Form:\n- $\\mathbf{A}=0\\mathbf{i}-8.0\\mathbf{j}$\n- $\\mathbf{B}=12.99\\mathbf{i}+7.5\\mathbf{j}$\n- $\\mathbf{C}=-10.88\\mathbf{i}-5.07\\mathbf{j}$\n- $\\mathbf{D}=-6.02\\mathbf{i}+7.99\\mathbf{j}$\n\nResultant of B + C:\n- Magnitude: 3.22 m\n- Direction: $49.4^{\\circ}$ from x - axis\n\nAlternative methods include graphical representation and trigonometric rules.",

    "answer":"**Step 1**\nAccording to Newton's Laws of Motion, when a net external force ($F$) acts on a body, it results in its acceleration and is given by:\n$F = ma$\nwhere $m$ is the mass of the body,\n$a$ is the acceleration of the body.\n\n**Explanation**:\nNewton's Laws of Motion: According to Newton's Laws of Motion, the force is the product of mass and acceleration of a body.\nAs a consequence, for the body to be at rest, the net external force acting on it should be zero, i.e. $\\sum F = 0$.\n\n**Step 2**\n(a)\nLet $a$ be the acceleration of both masses.\n\n**Explanation**:\nThey should have same acceleration as they are connected by a mass - less pulley and string system.\n\nThen using the kinematic equation;\n$s=ut+\\frac{1}{2}at^{2}$\nHere, $u$ is the initial velocity, i.e. zero,\n$s$ is the distance that the mass $m_{2}$ slides down,\n$t$ is the time taken.\n\nSubstituting $s = 1.55\\ m,t = 3.85\\ s,u = 0\\ m\/s$ into the above equation;\n$1.55\\ m=(0\\ m\/s)t+(\\frac{1}{2}\\times a\\times(3.85\\ s)^{2})$\n$a=\\frac{31\\ m}{(3.85\\ s)^{2}}$\n$a = 0.209\\ m\/s^{2}\\approx0.21\\ m\/s^{2}$\n\nTherefore, the acceleration of each object is $0.21\\ m\/s^{2}$.\n\n**Step 3**\n(b)\nLet $T$ be the tension in the string and $\\mu_{k}$ be the coefficient of kinetic friction between $m_{2}$ and incline.\n\nThen, for mass $m_{1}$:\n$T - m_{1}g=m_{1}a$\n$T=m_{1}a + m_{1}g$\n$T=m_{1}(g + a)$\n\nSubstituting $m_{1}=4\\ kg,g = 9.8\\ m\/s^{2},a = 0.21\\ m\/s^{2}$ into the above equation;\n$T = 4\\ kg\\times(9.8\\ m\/s^{2}+0.21\\ m\/s^{2})$\n$T = 40.04\\ N$\n\nTherefore, the tension in the string is $40.04\\ N$.\n\n**Step 4**\n(c)\nLet $N$ be the normal reaction exerted by the incline on the mass $m_{2}$.

    "answer":"**Step 1**\n\nA vibrating tuning fork produces a frequency $\\nu$. When one vibrates a tuning fork, the tines of the fork start moving outward and inward. This outward - inward movement is very fast and it produces a characteristic frequency. Such one outward and inward motion of the tuning fork constitutes an oscillation of the tuning fork. The amplitude of the oscillation will be smaller. Each tuning fork produces a characteristic frequency depending upon its properties. Tuning forks are of many usage in the field of acoustic physics and other branches of physics.\n\n**Explanation**:\n\nOne cycle of a tuning fork is the movement of the tines outward and inward once.\n\nAs oscillation starts from the mean position $\\text{X}$ goes to $\\text{Z}$ and then goes back through $\\text{X}$ to $\\text{Y}$ and then finally come back to $\\text{X}$.

    "answer":"Step 1\nConceptual Introduction\nThis is the balancing problem in terms of the electrostatic forces on particle 1 exerted by other charged particles according to the Coulomb's law. The forces are vectors, so they depend on the distance between the particles and charges.\nExplanation:\nCoulomb's law is the formula that describes the force between two point - charges:\n$F = k\\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$\nwhere $k$ is the Coulomb's constant $8.99\\times10^{9}\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C^{2}}$, $q_1$ and $q_2$ are charges, and $r$ is the distance between the charges.\nIn order for the net force on the particle 1 to be zero, all the force vectors exerted on it from particles 2, 3, and 4 have to balance out each other.\n\nStep 2\nFormulas to be Used\n1. Coulomb's Law:\n$F = k\\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$\n2. Force Components: Resolve forces into $x$ - and $y$ - components:\n- $F_x = F\\cos\\theta$\n- $F_y = F\\sin\\theta$\n3. Equilibrium Condition: Net force in both $x$ - and $y$ - directions must be zero:\n$\\sum F_x = 0$, $\\sum F_y = 0$.\nExplanation:\n- The force from the particle 2 acts along the $x$ - axis.\n- The forces from the particles 3 and 4 are symmetric about the $y$ - axis, so their $x$ - components add while their $y$ - components cancel each other.\n- Balancing the $x$ - components of all forces gives us the distance $D$.\n\nStep 3\nStep - by - Step Calculations\n(a) Finding Distance D\n1. Force of Particle 2 on Particle 1:\n$F_{12}=k\\frac{q_1q_2}{D^2}$\n2. Force of Particles 3 and 4 on Particle 1: The distance between particles 1 and 3 (or 4) is $d = 2.00cm$, and the angle $\\theta = 31^{\\circ}$. The force is:\n$F_{13}=F_{14}=k\\frac{q_1q_3}{d^2}$\nThe $x$ - component of the force is:\n$F_{13x}=F_{14x}=F_{13}\\cos\\theta = k\\frac{q_1q_3}{d^2}\\cos\\theta$\nSince the forces from 3 and 4 add along $x$, the total $x$ - component is:\n$F_{34x}=2\\cdot F_{13x}=2\\cdot k\\frac{q_1q_3}{d^2}\\cos\\theta$\n3. Equilibrium in the $x$ - Direction:\nThe $x$ - components of forces must balance:\n$F_{12}=F_{34x}$\nSubstituting expressions:\n$k\\frac{q_1q_2}{D^2}=2\\cdot k\\frac{q_1q_3}{d^2}\\cos\\theta$\nSimplify:\n$\\frac{q_2}{D^2}=2\\cdot\\frac{q_3}{d^2}\\cos\\theta$\nSolve for $D^{2}$:\n$D^{2}=\\frac{q_2d^2}{2q_3\\cos\\theta}$\nValues to be substituted:\n- $q_2 = 9.60\\times10^{-19}C$,\n- $q_3=-4.80\\times10^{-19}C$,\n- $d = 2.00cm = 0.02m$,\n- $\\cos\\theta=\\cos(31^{\\circ}) = 0.857$.\n$D^{2}=\\frac{(9.60\\times10^{-19})(0.02)^{2}}{2(- 4.80\\times10^{-19})(0.857)}$\nSimplify:\n$D^{2}=\\frac{(9.60)(0.0004)}{2(4.80)(0.857)}$\n$D^{2}=\\frac{0.00384}{8.2272}$\n$D^{2}=0.0004668$\n$D=\\sqrt{0.0004668}=0.0216m = 2.16cm$\n(b) Influence of Moving Particles 3 and 4\n- If the particles 3 and 4 are moved closer to the $x$ - axis, then the angle $\\theta$ is reduced.\n- As $\\cos\\theta$ increases, the denominator in the formula for $D^{2}$ increases; thus, $D$ decreases.\n- Hence, the required $D$ would be less than $2.16cm$.\nExplanation:\nThe forces are balanced along the $x$ - axis through Coulomb's law. There is no net force along the $y$ due to the symmetry in the $y$ - direction. Reducing the angle $\\theta$, the particles 3 and 4 will contribute more force along the $x$ - component. Thus, there is a requirement for the smaller $D$ for the balancing.\n\nAnswer\nFinal Answer\n(a) $D = 2.16cm$.\n(b) The required $D$ would be less than $2.16cm$.",

    "answer":"### Solution\n\n**Step 1**\n#### Theory behind the problem\nIn this problem it can easily be seen that different mechanical and electromagnetic systems and circuits are involved. A bar - conductor gliding on smooth rails in a uniform magnetic field is subjected to a force through the flow of current through it. When the switch is closed, there is a flow of current, this is given by Ohm's law ($I=\\frac{\\mathcal{E}}{R}$). The current interacts with the magnetic field ($B$) to produce a force ($F = ILB$) that moves the bar.\nWith this movement, the bar intersects the magnetic - field lines and thus the induced emf is equal to the product of the velocity of the bar, length and magnitude of the field ($\\mathcal{E}_{ind}=vLB$). However, the induced emf just like explained by Lenz's law works in the opposing direction relative to the battery's emf.\nHowever this reduces the effective emf forcing the current through the circuit to ($\\mathcal{E}_{eff}=\\mathcal{E}-\\mathcal{E}_{ind}$), hence it causes the current to reduce over time.\nAs we know, when the magnetic force acts upon a bar, the force of magnet in the bar decreases as the bar gains its speed. At some stage, the velocity increases until steady - state velocity ($v_t$) is attained at which the induced emf equals the battery emf and hence the current, and magnetic force, drops to zero.\nFrom here the bar continues to move uniformly that is there is no further acceleration of the bar. The dynamics of this system show how Faraday's law of induction works, and Lenz's law, as well as Newton's Second law of motion all in one place giving a clear view on how electric and magnetic forces counteract motion to attain balance.\n\n#### Problem Breakdown\nThis problem concerns a uniform conducting bar of mass ($m = 0.90\\ kg$) placed on two horizontal rails and experiencing the uniform magnetic field ($B = 2.4\\ T$). The system comprises the battery with emf ($\\mathcal{E}=12\\ V$) and the resistance in the circuit is ($R = 5.0\\ \\Omega$).\n\n#### Explanation\nThe bar is subjected to:\n1. A direct current coming from the battery, induce a magnetic force on the bar.\n2. An induced emf by a change in magnetic field which seeks to oppose the motion of the bar.\n\n#### The goal is to:\n1. Part A - Discuss the trend of velocity of the bar over time.\n2. Find its acceleration at the moment when an on - switch is closed (Part B).\n3. Discover how it accelerates at a specific speed (Part C).\n4. Calculate the terminal speed (Part D).\n\n#### Profile of Speed with Respect to Time\nThe bar attains a limiting velocity ($v_t$) because the force supplied by the current in the magnetic field and the back emf which is offered by the changing magnetic field.\nThe speed vs. time curve will: The correct graph is the first one which grows in an exponential fashion converging to ($v_t$). The first graph is correct.\n\n**Step 2**\n#### Part B: Acceleration Immediately After the Switch is Closed\n#### Explanation\nWhen the switch is first closed:\n- The bar is stationary ($v = 0$), so no induced emf exists.\n- The total current in the circuit is determined by Ohm's law: ($I=\\frac{\\mathcal{E}}{R}=\\frac{12}{5.0}=2.4\\ A$).\n- The magnetic force on the bar is: ($F = ILB$). Here ($L = 0.36\\ m$).\nSubstituting values: ($F=(2.4)(0.36)(2.4)=2.07\\ N$).\n- The magnetic force on the bar is: ($F = ILB$).\n- ($a=\\frac{F}{m}=\\frac{2.07}{0.90}\\approx2.30\\ m\/s^{2}$).\n\n**Final Answer (Part B)**: ($a = 2.30\\ m\/s^{2}$).\n\n**Step 3**\n#### Part C: Acceleration at ($v = 2.0\\ m\/s$)\nAt ($v = 2.0\\ m\/s$).\n#### Explanation\nThere is an induced emf ($\\mathcal{E}_{ind}$) due to the bar's motion, given by: ($\\mathcal{E}_{ind}=vLB=(2.0)(0.36)(2.4)=1.73\\ V$).\nThe net emf in the circuit is: ($\\mathcal{E}_{eff}=\\mathcal{E}-\\mathcal{E}_{ind}=12.0 - 1.73 = 10.27\\ V$).\nThe current is: ($I=\\frac{\\mathcal{E}_{eff}}{R}=\\frac{10.27}{5.0}\\approx2.05\\ A$).\nThe magnetic force is: ($F = ILB=(2.05)(0.36)(2.4)\\approx1.77\\ N$).\nThe acceleration is: ($a=\\frac{F}{m}=\\frac{1.77}{0.90}\\approx1.97\\ m\/s^{2}$).\n**Final Answer (Part C)**: ($a\\approx1.97\\ m\/s^{2}$).\n\n**Step 4**\n#### Part D: Terminal Speed\nAt terminal speed ($v_t$), the induced emf equals the battery emf ($\\mathcal{E}_{ind}=\\mathcal{E}$), so: ($v_tLB=\\mathcal{E}$).\nRearranging for ($v_t$): ($v_t=\\frac{\\mathcal{E}}{LB}=\\frac{12}{(0.36)(2.4)} = 13.89\\ m\/s$).\n**Final Answer (Part D)**: ($v_t = 13.89\\ m\/s$).\n\n### Answer\n#### Summary of Final Answers\n- Part A: The first graph is correct.\n- Part B: ($a = 2.30\\ m\/s^{2}$).\n- Part C: ($a\\approx1.97\\ m\/s^{2}$).\n- Part D: ($v_t = 13.89\\ m\/s$).",

This time, two trials are performed with the turntable starting at rest. On Trial 1, the turntable increases its motion very gradually, and the coin slips on the turntable surface when the coin moves any faster than 6 m\/s.

    "answer":"**Step 1 - Explanation - Part A: Drawing Vectors at Time t = 1 second and t = 2 seconds**\n1. Calculate the velocity of the coin at $t = 1$ second. The velocity ($v$) is given by the equation $v=6 - 2t$.\n   - At $t = 1$ second, $v = 6-2(1)=4\\ m\/s$.\n2. Calculate the tangential - acceleration ($a_t$) at $t = 1$ second. The tangential acceleration is given by the change in velocity over time. Since the velocity equation is a linear function of time, the tangential acceleration is constant and equal to the coefficient of $t$, which is $- 2\\ m\/s^{2}$. This value is negative because the turntable is slowing down.\n   - So, $a_t=-2\\ m\/s^{2}$ at $t = 1$ second.\n3. Calculate the centripetal acceleration ($a_c$) at $t = 1$ second. The centripetal acceleration is given by $a_c = v^{2}\/r$ where $r$ is the radius of the circular path. At $t = 1$ second, $v = 4\\ m\/s$ and $r = 4\\ m$, so $a_c=4^{2}\/4 = 4\\ m\/s^{2}$.\n4. Draw the vectors on the diagram for $t = 1$ second:\n   - Draw a velocity vector $v$ tangential to the circle, 2 squares long since each square represents $2\\ m\/s$.\n   - Draw a tangential acceleration vector $a_t$ opposite to the velocity vector, 1 square long (since each square represents $2\\ m\/s^{2}$ and $a_t=-2\\ m\/s^{2}$).\n   - Draw a centripetal acceleration vector $a_c$ pointing towards the centre of the circle, 2 squares long (since $a_c = 4\\ m\/s^{2}$).\n5. Calculate the velocity of the coin at $t = 2$ seconds.\n   - At $t = 2$ seconds, $v = 6-2(2)=2\\ m\/s$.\n6. Since the tangential acceleration ($a_t$) remains constant, it will be the same as at $t = 1$ second.\n   - So, $a_t=-2\\ m\/s^{2}$ at $t = 2$ seconds.\n7. Calculate the centripetal acceleration ($a_c$) at $t = 2$ seconds.\n   - At $t = 2$ seconds, $v = 2\\ m\/s$, so $a_c=2^{2}\/4 = 1\\ m\/s^{2}$.\n8. Draw the vectors on the diagram for $t = 2$ seconds:\n   - Draw a velocity vector $v$ tangential to the circle, 1 square long.\n   - Draw a tangential acceleration vector $a_t$ opposite to the velocity vector, 1 square long.\n   - Draw a centripetal acceleration vector $a_c$ pointing towards the centre of the circle, 0.5 square long (since $a_c = 1\\ m\/s^{2}$ and each square represents $2\\ m\/s^{2}$).\n\n**Step 2 - Explanation - Part B: Explanation for the difference in slipping speed between Trial 1 and Trial 2**\n1. Understand the conditions for slipping:\n   - The coin slips when it moves faster than $6\\ m\/s$.\n2. Analyze Trial 1:\n   - The turntable starts at rest and increases speed very gradually. This likely allows friction to act over a longer period to prevent slipping until the speed exceeds $6\\ m\/s$.\n3. Analyze Trial 2:\n   - The turntable's motion causes the coin's speed to increase at a rate of $8\\ m\/s^{2}$, leading to a quicker build - up of speed, reaching $4\\ m\/s$ before the coin slips.\n   - In Trial 1, the gradual increase in speed allows the static friction to adjust and hold the coin in place longer. In Trial 2, the rapid acceleration may overcome the static friction's maximum threshold sooner, causing the coin to slip at a lower speed.\n\n**Answer**\nPart A: At $t = 1\\ s$, velocity $v$ is $4\\ m\/s$ tangential, tangential acceleration $a_t$ is $-2\\ m\/s^{2}$ opposite to velocity, and centripetal acceleration $a_c$ is $4\\ m\/s^{2}$ towards the center; at $t = 2\\ s$, $v$ is $2\\ m\/s$ tangential, $a_t$ remains $-2\\ m\/s^{2}$ opposite to velocity, and $a_c$ is $1\\ m\/s^{2}$ towards the center.\nPart B: The coin slips at a lower speed in Trial 2 because the rapid acceleration of $8\\ m\/s^{2}$ overcomes the static - friction threshold quicker than the gradual increase in Trial 1, causing slippage at just $4\\ m\/s$ compared to exceeding $6\\ m\/s$ in Trial 1.",

    "answer":"1. **Step 1 - Force - balance and given values**:\n   - The mass of the ball is $m = 1.1\\times10^{-6}\\text{ kg}$, where $1\\text{ mg}=10^{-6}\\text{ kg}$. Let the tension in the thread be $T$.\n   - The electric - field due to the non - conducting sheet is $E=\\frac{\\sigma}{2\\epsilon_0}$, and the acceleration due to gravity is $g = 9.8\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}^2}$.\n   - From the force - balance diagram (where the vertical and horizontal components of the tension $T$ are considered), we have the following two equations based on Newton's first law (since the ball is in equilibrium):\n     - In the vertical direction: $T\\cos\\theta=mg$ (Equation (1)).\n     - In the horizontal direction: $T\\sin\\theta = F$, and since $F = qE$ (where $F$ is the electric force on the ball), we have $T\\sin\\theta=qE$ (Equation (2)).\n   - Explanation: The electric field due to a non - conducting sheet is $E = \\frac{\\sigma}{2\\epsilon_0}$, where $\\sigma$ is the surface charge density and $\\epsilon_0=8.85\\times10^{-12}\\text{ C}^2\/\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}^2$.\n2. **Step 2 - Solving for the surface charge density $\\sigma$**:\n   - Divide Equation (2) by Equation (1):\n     - $\\frac{T\\sin\\theta}{T\\cos\\theta}=\\frac{F}{mg}$, so $\\tan\\theta=\\frac{F}{mg}$, and $F = mg\\tan\\theta$.\n     - Since $F = qE$ and $E=\\frac{\\sigma}{2\\epsilon_0}$, we substitute $F$ to get $qE=mg\\tan\\theta$, then $q\\times\\frac{\\sigma}{2\\epsilon_0}=mg\\tan\\theta$.\n     - Solving for $\\sigma$, we have $\\sigma=\\frac{2\\epsilon_0mg\\tan\\theta}{q}$.\n     - Substitute the values $\\epsilon_0 = 8.85\\times10^{-12}\\text{ C}^2\/\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}^2$, $m = 1.1\\times10^{-6}\\text{ kg}$, $g = 9.8\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}^2}$, $\\theta = 30^{\\circ}$, and $q = 2.0\\times10^{-8}\\text{ C}$:\n       - $\\sigma=\\frac{2\\times8.85\\times10^{-12}\\times1.1\\times10^{-6}\\times9.8\\times\\tan30^{\\circ}}{2.0\\times10^{-8}}\\frac{\\text{C}}{\\text{m}^2}$.\n       - First, calculate the numerator: $2\\times8.85\\times10^{-12}\\times1.1\\times10^{-6}\\times9.8\\times\\tan30^{\\circ}=2\\times8.85\\times10^{-12}\\times1.1\\times10^{-6}\\times9.8\\times\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\n       - After the calculation, $\\sigma = 5.51\\times10^{-9}\\frac{\\text{C}}{\\text{m}^2}$.\n\n3. **Answer**:\n   - The surface charge density is $5.51\\times10^{-9}\\frac{\\text{C}}{\\text{m}^2}$.\n![](images\/149648065_aca0a27138e31e368b9cb64b1f4f875539ca984e1c15704f857b49933e879273.jpg)",

    "answer":"**Solution**\n\n**Step 1**\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the position along the horizontal axis where the total magnetic field due to the two current - carrying wires is zero.\n\n**Given Data**:\n1.

Separation between the wires: 1.82 cm = 0.0182 m\n\n**Magnetic Field Expression**:\nThe magnetic field at a distance $r$ from a long straight wire carrying current $I$ is given by:\n$B=\\frac{\\mu_0I}{2\\pi r}$\nwhere:\n- $B$ is the magnetic field,\n- $\\mu_0 = 4\\pi\\times10^{-7}\\ T\\cdot m\/A$ is the permeability of free space,\n- $r$ is the distance from the wire.\n\n**Explanation**:\nWe used the formula for the magnetic field produced by a long straight wire carrying current, which tells us how the strength of the magnetic field depends on the distance from the wire. The field decreases as you move farther from the wire.\n\n**Step 2**\n**Procedure**:\n1. Let the point where the magnetic fields cancel be at a distance $x$ to the right of wire 1.

    "answer":"**Solution**\n\n**Step 1**\n**Explanation**:\nThe energy that an object possesses as a result of motion is known as kinetic energy. Since it lacks direction and simply has magnitude, it is a scalar quantity.\nAn object's kinetic energy is determined by two factors:\n1. Its mass, or the amount of matter it contains.\n2. Its velocity, or the rate at which the thing moves.\nKinetic Energy Formula:\nThe following formula provides an object's kinetic energy ($K$):\n$K=\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$\nWhere:\n- $K$ is the object's kinetic energy, expressed in joules, or $J$.\n- $m$ is its mass, expressed in kilograms, or $kg$.\n- $v$ is its velocity, expressed in meters per second, or $\\frac{m}{s}$.\n**Important Points**:\n1. Directly proportional to mass: If the velocity remains constant, the kinetic energy rises as the object's mass does.\n2. Directly proportional to the square of velocity: Due to the square of the velocity ($v^{2}$), the kinetic energy rises more sharply as velocity increases.\n3. Units: The joule ($J$) is the unit of kinetic energy.\n - $1\\ J=1\\ kg\\cdot m^{2}\/s^{2}$\n**Example**:\nFor a two - kilogram ($2\\ kg$) object traveling at $3\\frac{m}{s}$ (three meters per second)\n$K = \\frac{1}{2}\\times2\\times(3)^{2}=\\frac{1}{2}\\times2\\times9 = 9J$\n**Applications**:\nKinetic energy is crucial for comprehending how objects move, how forces function, and how energy changes in mechanical systems. The work - energy theorem, which asserts that the work done on an item is equal to the change in its kinetic energy, also requires its analysis.\nYour difficulty appears to be connected to classical physics, with a particular emphasis on the ideas of kinetic energy, work, and forces. Below is a summary of the pertinent subjects and topics that are involved:\n - The kinetic energy\n - A force by work done\n - Theorem of work energy\n - Kinetic - Energy from Velocity\n**Conceptual Links That Are Relevant**:\nFrictionless Surface: The problem states that there is no energy loss from friction because the surface is frictionless. As a result, all effort is directed toward altering the kinetic energy of the object.\nPosition versus Force Graph: This suggests that the force acting on the item is position - dependent and not constant. In these situations, the force's work is represented by the area beneath the graph.\nThis kind of issue frequently arises in beginning physics classes, especially when studying energy, mechanics, and the work - energy theorem.\n\n**Step 2**\nLet's tackle the issue one step at a time:\n**Section A: Determine the Kinetic Energy at $x = 3m$**\nWe are provided with:\n - Speed at $x = 3m$, $v=6.41\\frac{m}{s}$\n - The object's mass, $m = 28.6kg$\nThe following formula provides the kinetic energy:\n$K=\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$\nChanging the specified values:\n$K=\\frac{1}{2}\\times28.6kg\\times(6.41)^{2}\\frac{m^{2}}{s^{2}}$\n$K=\\frac{1}{2}\\times28.6\\times(6.41)^{2}$\n$K = 14.3\\times(41.0881)$\n$K = 587.56383J$\nThus, when $x = 3$, the kinetic energy\nThe approximate value of $K = 587.58J$\n**Section B: Determine the Work Performed by the Force between $x = 3m$ and $x = 10m$**\nThis section requires us to compute the force's work. The area under the force vs. position graph represents the work performed by a variable force. Since the query doesn't include the graph, I'll presume that if we know the force's at particular locations or if we have the data, we can calculate the work completed.\nI will be able to precisely calculate the job completed if you can supply the graph or specify about the force values. We are unable to move on with this step without this information.\nFor the time being, I'll presume that you can either supply that information or that we must draw conclusions from the data that is now accessible.\n\n**Step 3**\n**Section C: Determine the Kinetic Energy at $x = 10m$**\nThe work - energy theorem can be applied once the work completed in Part B (represented by $W$) has been calculated.\n$\\Delta K=W$\nThe difference between the kinetic energy at $x = 10m$ and the change in kinetic energy when $x = 3m$:\n$K_{10}-K_{3}=W$\n$K_{10}=K_{3}+W$\nWe already know from Part A that $K_{3}=587.8J$\nAfter determining $W$ (from Part B), we may compute $K_{10}$.\n**Section D: Determine the speed at $x = 10m$**\nTo determine the speed at $x = 10m$\nWe apply the kinetic energy to velocity formula for:\n$K_{10}=\\frac{1}{2}mv_{10}^{2}$\nPutting the equation in a different order to find $v_{10}$:\n$v_{10}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2K_{10}}{m}}$\nOnce $K_{10}$ has been determined from Part C, enter it and the mass $28.6kg$ into the formula to determine the velocity $v_{10}$.\n\n**Answer**\n**Summary of the Final Response**:\n - Kinetic energy at $x = 3$: $K = 587.8J$ (from Part A)\n - The force's work between $x = 3m$ and $x = 10m$: The force vs. location graph is required to determine.\n - Energy of motion at $x = 10m$: $K_{10}=K_{3}+W$, where $W$ is the work completed (as established by the graph).\n - Speed at $x = 10m$: $v_{10}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2K_{10}}{m}}$ where $K_{10}$ is computed following the determination of $W$.",

    "answer":"Step 1\nStep 1: Conceptual Introduction\nThe circuit involved is a battery, resistor $R$ and inductor $L$. First, $S_1$ is closed and $S_2$ is open and hence a current flows constant in the circuit. If $S_1$ is opened and $S_2$ is closed, the battery is removed, so the resistor and inductor compose an RL - circuit. The resistor causes the instantaneous current to decay exponentially, while the inductor resists changes of current.\n\nKey concepts involved:\n1. RL Circuit Behavior: The energy stored in the inductor causes the current to decay exponentially when the battery is removed, as $I(t)=I_0e^{-t\/\\tau}$. The time constant $\\tau = \\frac{L}{R}$.\n2. Initial current: When $t = 0$, the battery ceases to load, and the circuit current is then equal to the steady - state current which existed when the battery was coupled to the circuit.\n\nStep 2: Solution\nGiven Data:\n- $\\mathcal{E}=66.0\\ V$\n- $R = 240.0\\ \\Omega$\n- $L=0.140\\ H$\n- $t = 4.00\\times10^{-4}\\ s$\n\nPart A: [Instantaneous Value of Current at the start of the Process; i.e. Just after the $S_2$ is closed and $S_1$ is opened].\n1. Steady - State Current before $S_1$ is Opened:\nThe current in the circuit before the battery is removed is given by Ohm's law:\n- $I_0=\\frac{\\mathcal{E}}{R}$\n2. Substitute the values:\n- $I_0=\\frac{66.0}{240.0}$\n3. Calculate:\n- $I_0 = 0.275\\ A$\n\nExplanation:\nSince the inductor does not tolerate a sudden change in current, the initial current in the resistor matches the steady - state current that is established with an applied voltage on the battery.\n\nFinal Answer for Part A: $I = 0.275\\ A$\n\nPart B: The Resistor Current at $t = 4.00\\times10^{-4}\\ s$\n1. Exponential Decay Formula:\nThe current in an RL circuit after the battery is removed follows:\n- $I(t)=I_0e^{-t\/\\tau}$\nIn this case, $\\tau=\\frac{L}{R}$ is the time constant.\n2. Calculate the Time Constant $\\tau$:\n- $\\tau=\\frac{L}{R}=\\frac{0.140}{240.0}$\n- $\\tau = 5.83\\times10^{-4}\\ s$\n3.

Simplify the exponent:\n- $\\frac{t}{\\tau}=\\frac{4.00\\times10^{-4}}{5.83\\times10^{-4}}\\approx0.686$\n- $I(t)=0.275e^{- 0.686}$\n5. Evaluate $e^{-0.686}$:\n- $e^{-0.686}\\approx0.504$\n- $I(t)=0.275\\times0.504$\n6. Calculate:\n- $I(t)\\approx0.139\\ A$\n\nExplanation:\nBecause the inductor stores energy, it decays exponentially with a resistor dissipating that energy. The amount of delay is determined by the 'time - constant', defined as the rate of the decay.\n\nFinal Answer for Part B: $I = 0.139\\ A$\n\nStep 2\nPart C: At a particular time, $t = 4.00\\times10^{-4}\\ s$, potential difference between points $b$ and $c$\n1. Voltage Across Inductor:\nThe potential difference across the inductor is given by:\n- $V_L = L\\frac{dI}{dt}$\n2. Current Decay Formula:\n- $I(t)=I_0e^{-t\/\\tau}$\nDifferentiate $I(t)$ with respect to $t$:\n- $\\frac{dI}{dt}=-\\frac{I_0}{\\tau}e^{-t\/\\tau}$\n3.

    "answer":"**Step 1 - Explanation**:\nTo find the first quartile (Q1) of a dataset, you need to determine the value below which 25% of the data falls. This is also known as the 25th percentile.\nHere are the steps to find the first quartile:\n1. Arrange the data in ascending order.\n2. Calculate the position of the first quartile using the formula: Position of Q1 = $\\frac{n + 1}{4}$ where n is the number of data points.\n3. If the position of Q1 is an integer, then Q1 is the data value at that position. If the position is not an integer, take the average of the data values at the two nearest positions.\n\n**Step 2 - Application to Dataset**:\nExplanation:\nSorting the given data points: 86,87,94,99,102,106,113,129,132,135,142,143,144,146,152,170\nCalculating the position of Q1:\nPosition of Q1 = $\\frac{17+ 1}{4}=\\frac{18}{4}=4.5$\nSince the position is not an integer, we take the average of the data values at positions 4 and 5: Q1 = $\\frac{99 + 102}{2}=\\frac{201}{2}=100.5$\nSimilarly,\nCalculating the position of Q3:\nPosition of Q3 = $3\\times\\frac{17 + 1}{4}=3\\times\\frac{18}{4}=\\frac{54}{4}=13.5$\nSince the position is not an integer, we take the average of the data values at positions 13 and 14: Q3 = $\\frac{143+144}{2}=\\frac{287}{2}=143.5$\nSo, the third quartile of the poultry hot - dog calorie counts is Q3 = 143.5\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: Q3 = 143.5\n\n**Answer**:\nSo, first quartile Q1 = 100.5\nand third quartile Q3 = 143.5",

    "answer":"**Step 1**\nFor this problem, we must consider the forces acting on the box at the point of interest B. We see that the object was dropped in such a way that it slid on the surface, so the only force that makes the body accelerate downwards is gravity. On the other hand, since the box slides on the surface, it exerts a force on the surface which is returned by Newton's third - law. We can perform a sum of forces to determine the value of the forces in question:\n$\\sum F = ma$\nAdditionally, the exercise gives us a straight - line equation $y = x$ that intersects the surface at point B. From there we can find the coordinates of the point and verify that the line is normal to the surface at that point.\n**Explanation**:\nTo determine where the line intersects the surface, it is enough to substitute $y = x$ into the surface equation.\n\n**Step 2**\nFirst, let's see what the coordinates of point B are:\nWe have the surface equation $x^{\\frac{1}{2}}+y^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 3$ and $y = x$.\nSubstitute $y = x$ into the surface equation:\n$$ \\begin{align*} x^{\\frac{1}{2}}+x^{\\frac{1}{2}}&=3\\\\ 2x^{\\frac{1}{2}}&=3\\\\ x^{\\frac{1}{2}}&=\\frac{3}{2}\\\\ x&=\\frac{9}{4} \\end{align*} $$\nNow, let's determine the slope of the line normal to the surface at $x=\\frac{9}{4}$.\nStarting from $x^{\\frac{1}{2}}+y^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 3$, we can rewrite it as $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}=3 - x^{\\frac{1}{2}}$, then $y=(3 - x^{\\frac{1}{2}})^2=9 - 6x^{\\frac{1}{2}}+x$.\nDifferentiating $y$ with respect to $x$: $y^\\prime=- 3x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}+1$.\nEvaluating the derivative at $x = \\frac{9}{4}$:\n$$ \\begin{align*} y^\\prime\\left(x=\\frac{9}{4}\\right)&=-3\\left(\\frac{9}{4}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}+1\\\\ y^\\prime\\left(\\frac{9}{4}\\right)&=-1 \\end{align*} $$\nThe slope of the normal line is $\\frac{-1}{y^\\prime\\left(\\frac{9}{4}\\right)} = 1$.\nSo the line $y = x$ with slope $1$ is normal to the surface at B.\n**Explanation**:\nWe remember that the negative reciprocal of the slope of this line must be equal to the derivative of the surface equation evaluated at the point.\n\n**Step 3**\nNow, let's review the forces on the box just at point B. If we consider a reference system where the $x^\\prime$ - axis is tangent to the surface at B and the $y^\\prime$ - axis is normal to the surface at B, we can draw the following force diagram:\n[Here is a description of a force - diagram with a normal force $\\mathbf{F_N}$, a weight force $mg$ and an angle $\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ between the weight vector and the normal - to - surface axis]\nWhere $\\mathbf{F_N}$ is the normal force and $mg$ is the weight force.\n**Explanation**:\nNote that the angle is $45^{\\circ}$ because of the slope of the line normal to the surface at B that we found in the previous step. $\\theta=\\arctan(1)$\n\n**Step 4**\nFinally, let's see that the box does not move in the $y^\\prime$ - direction, so the acceleration in this axis is zero. According to Newton's second law, the sum of forces in this axis must also be zero. So:\n$$ \\begin{align*} \\sum F_{y^\\prime}&=0\\\\ \\sum F_{y^\\prime}&=F_N - mg\\cos\\theta\\\\ \\sum F_{y^\\prime}&=F_N-(5\\text{kg})\\left(9.8\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}^2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\\\ 0&=F_N-(34.65\\text{N})\\\\ F_N&=34.65\\text{N} \\end{align*} $$\n**Explanation**:\nWe see that this normal force found is the one that the surface exerts on the box in the positive $y^\\prime$ direction, and the exercise asks for the force that the box exerts on the surface. But the force that the box exerts on the surface has the same magnitude but in the opposite direction to the previously found $F_N$ (by Newton's third law).\n\n**Answer**\nThe magnitude of the normal force that the box exerts on the surface is $34.65\\text{N}$\n![](images\/149614370_2e3ee97f2b441c8937b9bb9dae9e02b1b2dd59d1a85c045737e950d7fda7105a.jpg)",

    "answer":"**Step 1**\nExplanation:\nTo solve this problem, we can use Gauss's Law, which states that the electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the enclosed charge divided by the permittivity of free - space ($\\varepsilon_0$).\nFor a spherical shell with uniform charge distribution, the electric field outside the shell behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere. Therefore, the electric field at a distance r from the center of the shell is given by:\n$E = \\frac{k\\cdot Q}{r^{2}}$\nWhere:\n- E is the electric field magnitude at distance r,\n- k is Coulomb's constant ($8.9875\\times10^{9}\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C^{2}}$),\n- Q is the total charge enclosed within the spherical shell, and\n- r is the distance from the center of the shell.\n\n**Step 2**\nExplanation:\nGiven that $E = 4.8\\times10^{6}\\frac{N}{C}$ and $r = 0.60m$, we can use the formula to solve for Q:\n$Q=\\frac{E\\cdot r^{2}}{k}$\n$Q=\\frac{(4.8\\times 10^{6}\\frac{N}{C})\\cdot(0.60m)^{2}}{8.9875\\times 10^{9}\\frac{N\\cdot m^{2}}{C^{2}}}$\n$Q\\approx\\frac{1.728\\times 10^{-3}C}{8.9875\\times 10^{9}}$\n$Q\\approx192\\mu C$\nSo, the value of Q is approximately $192\\mu C$.\n\n**Answer**\nAmong the given options, none matches exactly with $192\\mu C$.

    "question":"Hummingbirds may seem fragile, but their wings are capable of sustaining very large forces and accelerations. (Figure 1) shows data for the vertical position of the wing tip of a rufous hummingbird. What is the maximum acceleration of the wing tips, in m\/s\u00b2? What is the maximum acceleration of the wing tips, in units of g? Please answer with explanations in each step... I am very confused. Thank you!!\nThe graph shows a sinusoidal - like variation of the vertical position $y$ (in mm) of the wing - tip with time $t$ (in ms).\n### Step 1: Determine the equation of motion\nThe general equation for simple harmonic motion is $y = A\\sin(\\omega t+\\varphi)$, where $A$ is the amplitude, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, $t$ is time, and $\\varphi$ is the phase constant. From the graph, the amplitude $A = 40\\space mm=0.04\\space m$. The period $T$ of the motion can be determined from the graph. The time between two consecutive peaks is $T = 40\\space ms = 0.04\\space s$.\nThe angular frequency $\\omega$ is related to the period by the formula $\\omega=\\frac{2\\pi}{T}$. Substituting $T = 0.04\\space s$ into the formula, we get $\\omega=\\frac{2\\pi}{0.04}= 50\\pi\\space rad\/s$.\n### Step 2: Find the velocity and acceleration equations\nThe velocity $v$ of an object in simple - harmonic motion is the first - derivative of the position function with respect to time. Given $y = A\\sin(\\omega t+\\varphi)$, then $v=\\frac{dy}{dt}=A\\omega\\cos(\\omega t+\\varphi)$.\nThe acceleration $a$ is the second - derivative of the position function with respect to time. Differentiating the velocity function, we get $a=\\frac{dv}{dt}=-A\\omega^{2}\\sin(\\omega t+\\varphi)$.\nThe maximum value of the acceleration occurs when $\\vert\\sin(\\omega t+\\varphi)\\vert = 1$. So, the maximum acceleration $a_{max}=A\\omega^{2}$.\n### Step 3: Calculate the maximum acceleration in m\/s\u00b2\nSubstitute $A = 0.04\\space m$ and $\\omega = 50\\pi\\space rad\/s$ into the formula for $a_{max}$:\n$$ \\begin{align*} a_{max}&=A\\omega^{2}\\\\ &=0.04\\times(50\\pi)^{2}\\\\ &=0.04\\times2500\\pi^{2}\\\\ & = 100\\pi^{2}\\space m\/s^{2}\\\\ &\\approx 100\\times9.87\\\\ &=987\\space m\/s^{2} \\end{align*} $$\n### Step 4: Calculate the maximum acceleration in units of $g$\nWe know that $g = 9.8\\space m\/s^{2}$. To express the acceleration in units of $g$, we divide $a_{max}$ by $g$:\n$$ n=\\frac{a_{max}}{g}=\\frac{100\\pi^{2}}{9.8}\\approx\\frac{987}{9.8}\\approx100.7 $$\nSo, the maximum acceleration of the wing - tips in m\/s\u00b2 is $100\\pi^{2}\\approx987\\space m\/s^{2}$, and in units of $g$ is approximately $100.7g$.\n<image>",

So the electric field at $r > R$ is zero.\n(ii) For $r = R$\nNow for $r = R$, that's on the surface also, the charge enclosed will be zero. So here also, the electric field will be zero.\n(iii) For $r < R$\nConsider a gaussian sphere of radius $r$ inside the sphere.\nLet $q'$ be the charge on the inner gaussian surface of radius $r$.\nWe know that volume charge density is constant throughout the sphere which is $\\rho=\\frac{-e}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^{3}}$.\nIf $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^{3}$ volume contains $-e$ charge, then let $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}$ volume contains $q'$ charge.\nSo we can write,\n$\\frac{q'}{-e}=\\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^{3}}$\n$q'=-e(\\frac{r^{3}}{R^{3}})$\nNow the Total charge inside the inner gaussian surface can be written as $q_{enc}=e + q'=e - e(\\frac{r^{3}}{R^{3}})=e(1 - \\frac{r^{3}}{R^{3}})$\nSo Applying gauss law.\nThe area of the inner gaussian sphere is $A = 4\\pi r^{2}$\nSubstitute all these in eq - 1.\n$E_{r < R}=\\frac{e(1-\\frac{r^{3}}{R^{3}})}{4\\pi r^{2}\\epsilon_0}$\n$E_{r < R}=\\frac{e}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r^{2}}(1 - \\frac{r^{3}}{R^{3}})$\nIf we substitute $r = R$, we get Electric field as zero on the surface.

    "answer":"### Solution\n\n#### Step 1\n**Given Information**\n- Mass of the disk: $m = 1.0\\ kg$\n- Radius of the disk: $r = 2.0\\ m$\n- Forces acting on the disk:\n  - $F_1=40.0\\ N$ at an angle of $30^{\\circ}$ from the horizontal\n  - $F_2 = 5.0\\ N$ acting vertically downward\n- Moment of inertia of the disk about its center (for a solid disk):\n$I=\\frac{1}{2}mr^{2}=\\frac{1}{2}(1.0)(2.0)^{2}=2.0\\ kg\\cdot m^{2}$\n\n**Explanation**:\nWe identified the important details: the disk's mass, radius, and the forces acting on it. We also noted the direction and magnitude of the forces and determined the disk's resistance to rotation using its moment of inertia.\n\n#### Step 2\n**2. Torque Calculation**\nThe torque ($\\tau$) is given by:\n$\\tau = rF_{\\text{perpendicular}}$\nFor each force, we calculate the perpendicular component of the force to the radius of the disk.\n(a) **Torque due to $F_1$**: The perpendicular component of $F_1$ is:\n$F_{1\\perp}=F_1\\sin(30^{\\circ}) = 40.0\\times0.5 = 20.0\\ N$\nThe torque due to $F_1$ is:\n$\\tau_1=rF_{1\\perp}=2.0\\times20.0 = 40.0\\ N\\cdot m$\n(b) **Torque due to $F_2$**: The force $F_2$ is already perpendicular to the radius of the disk. Its torque is:\n$\\tau_2 = rF_2=2.0\\times5.0 = 10.0\\ N\\cdot m$\n(c) **Net Torque**: The direction of the torques matters. Let clockwise torques be positive and counter - clockwise torques be negative. $F_1$ creates a counter - clockwise torque, while $F_2$ creates a clockwise torque.\nThus, the net torque is:\n$\\tau_{\\text{net}}=-\\tau_1+\\tau_2=- 40.0 + 10.0=-30.0\\ N\\cdot m$\n\n**Explanation**:\nWe calculated the twisting effect (torque) caused by each force. For $F_1$, we found its perpendicular component using the angle provided. $F_2$ was already perpendicular, so we directly calculated its torque. Finally, we combined the torques, considering their directions (clockwise or counter - clockwise).\n\n#### Step 3\n**3. Angular Acceleration**\nThe angular acceleration ($\\alpha$) is related to the net torque and moment of inertia by:\n$\\alpha=\\frac{\\tau_{\\text{net}}}{I}$\nSubstitute the values:\n$\\alpha=\\frac{-30.0}{2.0}=-15.0\\ rad\/s^{2}$\n\n**Explanation**:\nWe used the net torque (total twisting force) and the disk's resistance to rotation (moment of inertia) to find how fast the disk spins faster or slower - its angular acceleration.\n\n### Answer\nThe angular acceleration of the disk is: $-15\\ rad\/s^{2}$",

    "answer":"### Solution\n\n#### Step 1\n** Introduction or Overview of the Question**\n\nThis problem involves determining the total work required to lift a piston inside a cylinder using an expanding gas. The piston is subject to both gravitational force and spring force, which oppose its motion as it is raised. We are also tasked with determining the initial and final pressures in the cylinder, assuming atmospheric pressure is 100 kPa.\n\n**Key points in the problem**:\n- The piston has a mass of 8 kg and a cross - sectional area of 0.002 m\u00b2.\n- The piston is raised by a distance of 0.15 meters.\n- The spring has a spring constant of 4,000 N\/m.\n- The surrounding atmospheric pressure is 100 kPa.\n- The gas in the cylinder does the work to lift the piston against gravity and the spring's force.\n\n**Our goal is to**:\n1. Calculate the total work done to lift the piston.\n2. Find the initial and final gauge pressures inside the cylinder.\n\nWe will break this problem into manageable steps, first calculating the work done against gravity, then calculating the work done against the spring, and lastly calculating the work required for the gas expansion.\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe problem involves calculating the total work required to lift a piston and determining the pressure changes during expansion.\n\n#### Step 2\n** Work Done Against Gravitational Force**\n\nTo calculate the work done to lift the piston, we first need to determine the force due to gravity acting on the piston. The gravitational force is calculated using:\n$$ F_{gravity}=m\\cdot g $$\nWhere:\n- $m = 8\\mathrm{kg}$ (mass of the piston),\n- $g = 9.8\\mathrm{m\/s^2}$ (acceleration due to gravity).\n\nSo, the force due to gravity is:\n$$ F_{gravity}=8\\mathrm{kg}\\cdot9.8\\mathrm{m\/s^2}=78.4\\mathrm{N} $$\n\nThe work done against gravity is calculated using the formula:\n$$ W_{gravity}=F_{gravity}\\cdot d $$\nWhere:\n- $d = 0.15\\mathrm{m}$ is the distance the piston moves.\n\nNow, substituting the values:\n$$ W_{gravity}=78.4\\mathrm{N}\\cdot0.15\\mathrm{m}=11.76\\mathrm{J} $$\n\nThus, the work done against gravity is 11.76 J.\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe gravitational force opposes the upward movement of the piston, and the work done against this force is calculated by multiplying the force with the displacement. The force results from the piston's weight in the gravitational field.\n\n#### Step 3\n** Work Done Against Spring Force**\n\nThe work done to compress or stretch the spring is determined by Hooke's Law. The force exerted by the spring is given by:\n$$ F_{spring}=k\\cdot x $$\nWhere:\n- $k = 4000\\mathrm{N\/m}$ is the spring constant,\n- $x = 0.15\\mathrm{m}$ is the displacement of the piston.\n\nThe work done against the spring is given by the formula:\n$$ W_{spring}=\\frac{1}{2}kx^{2} $$\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$ W_{spring}=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot4000\\mathrm{N\/m}\\cdot(0.15\\mathrm{m})^{2} $$\n$$ W_{spring}=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot4000\\cdot0.0225 = 45\\mathrm{J} $$\n\nThus, the work done against the spring is 45 J.\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe spring opposes the piston's upward motion. The work done against the spring is calculated using the spring constant and displacement, considering the spring's resistance to change.\n\n#### Answer\n** Final Answer**\n- Total work required: $56.76\\mathrm{J}$ (since $W_{total}=W_{gravity}+W_{spring}=11.76 + 45=56.76\\mathrm{J}$)\n- Initial pressure: 100 kPa (atmospheric pressure)\n- Final pressure: Requires further thermodynamic calculations, but would be higher than 100 kPa due to the gas expansion.",

    "answer":"**Solution**\n\n**Step 1**\n**Given Data**\n- Wavelength of light, $\\lambda = 515nm=515\\times 10^{-9}m$\n- Slit width, $b = 90\\mu m = 90\\times 10^{- 6}m$\n- Distance from slit to screen, $L = 2m$\n- Polarizer 1 occupies $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the slit width with a vertical transmission axis.\n- Polarizer 2 occupies $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the slit width with a transmission axis normal to the page.\n- Incoming light is polarized at $45^{\\circ}$ to each polarizer.\n\nThe problem is related to diffraction and polarization of light. In single - slit diffraction the light waves get spread out and come out from the other side with a diffraction pattern on the screen as bright and dark fringes. The condition for zero irradiance (dark fringes) is governed by the single - slit diffraction equation:\n$b\\sin\\theta=m\\lambda$,\n$m = 1,2,3,\\cdots$\n\n**Explanation**:\nHere $b$ is the slit width, $\\lambda$ is the wavelength, and $m$ is the order of the dark fringe. For small angles, $\\sin\\theta\\approx\\tan\\theta = y\/L$, where $y$ is the fringe position and $L$ is the distance to the screen.\nThe measurements done on the irradiance of the polarizers are described by Malus's Law. The intensity of the transmitted polarized light through the polarizer is given by $\\cos^{2}\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the light's polarization direction and the polarizer's transmission axis.

Diffraction pattern first reaches zero irradiance at a distance of: $1.144cm$ from the optical axis.\n- b. The irradiance of the central maximum increases by a factor of: $2$\n\nThe diffraction pattern is developed owing to the fact that the light waves passing through the slit interfere with each other. The positions of the dark fringes both depend on the design of the experiment as well as the specific wavelength of the light source used. The silicon layer and the first polarizer cause an addition of further intensity reduction because the light is only partially transmitted as the result of its polarization with the plane perpendicular to the polarizers' axes.\nWhen the polarizers are removed, all the light which is cast through the slit passes in to the central maximum whose intensity is therefore doubled.\n\n**Explanation**:\nThis show how polarization can be employed to regulate the brightness of light, the application being in polarizing filters and many optical systems.\n\n**Answer**\n**Final Answers**\n- a) The diffraction pattern first reaches zero irradiance at $1.144cm$.\n- b) The irradiance of the central maximum increases by a factor of $2$",

    "question":"A rocket accelerates upward from rest. In the first - stage, it has a constant acceleration of $a_1 = 72\\frac{m}{s^2}$ for $t_1=29s$. Then the first stage detaches and the second - stage fires, providing a constant acceleration of $a_2 = 38\\frac{m}{s^2}$ for the time interval $t_2 = 71s$.\n**Part (a)**\nWe use the kinematic equation $v = v_0+at$. Since the rocket starts from rest ($v_0 = 0$), the speed $v_1$ of the rocket at time $t_1$ is given by the equation $v_1=a_1t_1$.\n**Part (b)**\nThe speed of the rocket at the end of the first - stage is $v_1=a_1t_1$. This speed becomes the initial speed for the second - stage of acceleration.\nUsing the kinematic equation $v = v_0+at$ again, where $v_0 = a_1t_1$ and $a = a_2$ and $t=t_2$, the speed $v_2$ at the end of the second - stage of acceleration is $v_2=a_1t_1 + a_2t_2$.\n**Part (c)**\n1. First, find the distance traveled in the first stage:\n   - We use the kinematic equation $x_1=v_0t_1+\\frac{1}{2}a_1t_1^2$. Since $v_0 = 0$, $x_1=\\frac{1}{2}a_1t_1^2$.\n2. Then, find the distance traveled in the second stage:\n   - We use the kinematic equation $x_2=v_1t_2+\\frac{1}{2}a_2t_2^2$, and since $v_1=a_1t_1$, we have $x_2=a_1t_1t_2+\\frac{1}{2}a_2t_2^2$.\n3.

    "answer":"**Solution**\n\n**Step 1**\n**(a) Frequency of $(y_1(x,t))$**\nThe wave equation is:\n$y_1(x,t)=4\\cos(20t - 0.3x)\\text{ [cm]}$\nThe term $(20t)$ represents the angular frequency $(\\omega)$, where:\n$\\omega = 20\\text{ rad\/s}$\nThe frequency $(f)$ is related to $(\\omega)$ as:\n$f=\\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}=\\frac{20}{2\\pi}\\approx3.18\\text{ Hz}$\n\n**Explanation**:\nIn this step we can find the frequency of $y_1(x,t)$. Frequency means number of cycles per second.\n\n**Step 2**\n**(b) Wavelength of $(y_1(x,t))$**\nThe wave number $(k)$ is given as $(0.3\\text{ rad\/cm})$.\nThe wavelength $(\\lambda)$ is related to $(k)$ as:\n$k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$\nBy using $\\lambda=\\frac{2\\pi}{k}=\\frac{2\\pi}{0.3}\\approx20.94\\text{ cm}$\n\n**Explanation**:\nIn this step we can find wavelength $(\\lambda)$.

Phase velocity means the speed at which a wave's phase moves through a medium.\n\n**Step 4**\n**(d) Expression for $(y_2(x,t))$ and $(y_s(x,t))$**\nThe reflected wave $(y_2(x,t))$ must have the same amplitude and wavelength as $(y_1(x,t))$, but it travels in the $(-x)$ - direction and has a phase difference due to reflection.\nThus:\n$y_2(x,t)=4\\cos(20t + 0.3x)$\nThe total wave $(y_s(x,t))$ is the sum of $(y_1(x,t))$ and $(y_2(x,t))$:\n$y_s(x,t)=y_1(x,t)+y_2(x,t)$\nBy putting $(y_1(x,t)=4\\cos(20t - 0.3x))$ and $(y_2(x,t)=4\\cos(20t + 0.3x))$:\n$y_s(x,t)=4\\cos(20t - 0.3x)+4\\cos(20t + 0.3x)$\nBy using the trigonometric identity:\n$\\cos(A)+\\cos(B)=2\\cos(\\frac{A + B}{2})\\cos(\\frac{A - B}{2})$\n$y_s(x,t)=8\\cos(20t)\\cos(0.3x)$\n\n**Answer**\n(a).

    "answer":"Step - by - Step Solution:\n\nStep 1: If you understand the Circuit Configuration\n1. There are two switches $S_1$ and $S_2$, an inductor $L = 1\\ H$, two voltage sources $\\varepsilon=10\\ V$\n2. Immediately after, switch $S_1$ is closed while $S_2$ is open for a long time. The current through the inductor reaches a steady - state it becomes constant.\n3. The substitution is performed while $S_2$ is being treated as closed, so that a loop, added with more components (a resistor $2R$ and a voltage source $30\\ V$) is formed.\n\nStep 2: Prior to closing $S_2$ Steady - state Current\n - Since, switch $S_1$ is closed for quite sometime, the current through the inductor reaches constant value.\n - Since the inductor is shorted in the steady - state, that is to say, it doesn't present any resistance to the DC current.\n - The voltage $\\varepsilon = 10\\ V$ is the only factor on the voltage source that determines the amount of current $I$ flowing in the inductor.\n - Ohm's Law for the initial current: $I_{initial}=\\frac{\\varepsilon}{R}=\\frac{10}{R}$ (steady - state current)\n\nStep 3: Behavior of Inductor When Switch $S_2$ is Closed\nExplanation:\nHere, in case switch $S_2$ is closed the inductor is going to oppose any sudden change in the current through it due to self - inductance.\n - According to the properties of inductors:\n    - Just after closing the switch the inductor momentarily holds the same current($I_{initial}=\\frac{10}{R}$).\n    - A new configuration of the circuit changes the rate of current change $\\frac{dI}{dt}$.\n\nStep 4: Write Kirchhoff's Voltage Law for the New Loop.\nAfter $S_2$ is closed, the inductor $L$ is part of the following loop:\n - Loop that I recall myself is this path: $B\\rightarrow C\\rightarrow D\\rightarrow E\\rightarrow B$.\n - Components in the loop:\n    - A voltage source $10\\ V$ (from the left branch).\n    - Voltage number $30\\ V$ in the right branch.\n    - There are: Resistors $R$ and $2R$.\n    - An inductor $L$ (an element which opposes any change in current).\nApply Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL):\n - Sum of voltage drops around the loop: $\\varepsilon - L\\frac{dI}{dt}-IR - 2RI=3\\varepsilon$\nSubstituting the values:\n - $\\varepsilon = 10\\ V$,\n - Inductance $L = 1\\ H$,\n - $3\\varepsilon=30\\ V$:\n    - $10 - L\\frac{dI}{dt}-IR - 2RI = 30$\nSimplify:\n - $L\\frac{dI}{dt}=40 - 3RI$\n\nStep 5: Substitute Initial Current into the Equation\n - Just after $S_2$ is closed, the current through the inductor is still the initial steady - state value.\n - $I=\\frac{10}{R}$\n - Substitute $I = \\frac{10}{R}$ into the KVL equation:\n    - $L\\frac{dI}{dt}=40 - 3R(\\frac{10}{R})$\n    - Simplify the terms:\n    - $L\\frac{dI}{dt}=40 - 30=10\\ A\/s$\n\nStep 6: Conclusion\nThe magnitude of the rate of change of current in the inductor immediately after switch $S_2$ is closed is:\n - $10\\ A\/s$\nExplanation:\nThis value specifies at what rate the current in the inductor change, right after the switch has been closed. As inductors oppose abrupt changes to the current, the rate of change of current expresses the contribution of the new voltage source and resistance to the circuit.\n\nAnswer\nExplanation:\nIf we close switch $S_1$ and open switch $S_2$, delaying this for a long time, the circuit comes to steady state and the inductor acts as a short circuit (zero resistance to DC current). The initial current through the inductor is determined by Ohm's law:\n - $I_{initial}=\\frac{\\varepsilon}{R}=\\frac{10}{R}$\nKey Concept:\nInductors do not appreciate sudden current changes. When switch $S_2$ is closed the configuration of the circuit is currently different than when we found the last time, and we must find the rate of change of current $\\frac{dI}{dt}$ through the inductor.\nApply Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL):\nIn the loop $B\\rightarrow C\\rightarrow D\\rightarrow E\\rightarrow B$, applying KVL:\n - $10 - L\\frac{dI}{dt}-IR - 2RI = 30$\nSubstituting $L = 1\\ H,\\varepsilon = 10\\ V$, and $I=\\frac{10}{R}$ (initial steady - state current):\n - $L\\frac{dI}{dt}=40 - 3R(\\frac{10}{R})=40 - 30 = 10\\ A\/s$\nConclusion:\nThe magnitude of the rate of change of current in the inductor just after the switch $S_2$ is closed is:\n - $10\\ A\/s$\nThis result demonstrates that the inductor resists change in current, but the current in the new circuit configuration changes at a rate of $10\\ A\/s$. This rapid change is due to the combined effects of the addition of the voltage source of $30\\ V$ and of the resistances $R$ and $2R$.",

Shortest time from House A to House B ($\\Delta t_{AB}$)\nKey Concept:\nThe shortest time corresponds to driving the boat directly toward House B without compensating for the river's current.

    "answer":"**Step 1**\nQ1. Current will flow in resistance $R_1$ from B to P because B is at higher potential and P is at lower potential. So correct choice is (A)\nQ2. (A) No, because current intensity through both points is same because current supply by battery at point A is equal to current receive by battery at point M.

Current at point K = 1 + 1 = 2A\n**Explanation**: Since current through $R_3=\\frac{V_B - V_J}{R_3}=\\frac{8 - 0}{8}=1A$, that means current through K = 1A+1A = 2A, similarly current through L is 3A, and current through M is 4A.\n(C) Incorrect because current through F is equal to current through G,H,I\n(D) Correct, yes these are at zero potential\n(E) No, its incorrect, there is 1A at I and J, 2A at K, 3A at L, and 4A at point M.\n**Step 2**\nQ3.

    "answer":"**Step 1**\nFirst calculate the modulus of rigidity of the bolt material from the stress - strain diagram. Use relation between modulus of rigidity, Poisson's ratio and modulus of elasticity to calculate modulus of elasticity of the material. Use definition of shear stress to calculate required force P.\n- **Hook\u2019s Law**: Hook's law establishes the relation between the stress and strain for a particular material, relation results in a ratio for each stress and strain combination of the material. These constant values are known as elastic constant.\n- **Yield stress**: Yield stress is the value of the stress at which the material is at the verge to go in the plastic region of the material deformation.\n- The expression of modulus of rigidity of material by Hook's law is expressed as, $G=\\frac{\\tau}{\\gamma}$\n  - here, $\\tau$ is the shear stress and $\\gamma$ is the shear strain.\n- The relation between modulus of rigidity, Poisson's ratio and modulus of elasticity is as below, $E = 2G(1+\\mu)$\n  - Here, $E$ is the modulus of elasticity, $G$ is the modulus of rigidity and $\\mu$ is Poisson's ratio.\n- The expression for shear stress is as below, $\\tau=\\frac{P}{A}$\n  - Here, $P$ is applied shear force and $A$ is the area of cross - section.\n- Now, write the expression for the modulus of the rigidity of the bolt. $G=\\frac{\\tau_y}{\\gamma}$\n  - Here, $\\tau_y$ is yield shear stress and the $\\gamma$ is shear strain in the bolt at the $\\tau_y$ stress.\n  - Substitute $50$ ksi for $\\tau_y$ and $0.004$ for $\\gamma$, $G=\\frac{50\\ ksi}{0.004}=12,500$ ksi\n- Write the expression for modulus of elasticity of the bolt. $E = 2G(1+\\nu)$\n  - Here, $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio.\n  - Substitute $12,500$ ksi for $G$ and $0.3$ for $\\nu$. $E = 2(12,500\\ ksi)(1 + 0.3)=32,500$ ksi\n\n**Explanation**: The value of the shear stress and corresponding shear strain has been obtained from the stress - strain curve of the bolt material. The expression for the shear modulus provided by the Hook's law has been used to calculate the value of the shear modulus of the bolt material. The relation between the shear modulus and the modulus of the elasticity has been used to calculate the value of the modulus of the elasticity.\n\n**Step 2**\n- Write the expression for area of cross - section of the bolt. $A=\\frac{\\pi}{4}d^{2}$\n  - Here, $A$ is area of the cross - section of the bolt.\n  - Substitute $0.25$ in for $d$. $A=\\frac{\\pi}{4}(0.25\\ in)^{2}=0.049\\ in^{2}$\n- Write the expression for the yield shear stress in the terms of the force $P$. $\\tau_y=\\frac{P}{A}$\n  - Substitute $50$ ksi for $\\tau_y$, $0.049\\ in^{2}$ for $A$. $P=(50\\ ksi)(0.049\\ in^{2}) = 2.454$ kip\n\n**Explanation**: Cross - section area of the bolt is calculated as the diameter of the bolt has been provided.

    "answer":"**Step 1**\n(1) Gauss's law can be used to determine the electric field between the two spheres. Between the two spheres, we select a Gaussian surface that is a spherical shell with radius $r$. We can take the electric field outside of the integral because it is radial and has the same magnitude throughout the Gaussian surface and the enclosed charge is $Q$.\nSo, using Gauss's law:\n$\\int E.dA=\\frac{Q}{\\epsilon_{0}}$\nExplanation:\nWhere, the integral is over the Gaussian shell's surface - area and $\\epsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of free space.\nSince the spherical shell's surface area is $4\\pi r^{2}$, so:\n$E(r).4\\pi r^{2}=\\frac{Q}{\\epsilon_{0}}$\n$E(r)=\\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}r^{2}}$\nHere, $E(r)$ is the electric - field strength between the two spheres as a function of $r$, the distance from the sphere centres.\n\n**Step 2**\n(2) We must integrate the electric field from the negative electrode (at $R_{1}$) to the positive electrode (at $R_{2}$) in order to determine the potential difference between the two spheres.

Voltage across the resistor with the ammeter in the circuit: $V'_R = 4.5455\\ V$.\n\nStep - by - Step Solution:\n\nStep 1: Determine the sum voltage of the circuit ($\\varepsilon$).\nExplanation:\nWhen the ammeter is not in the circuit, the resistor is connected directly to the voltage source, and the voltage across the resistor ($V_R$) is equal to the source voltage:\n- $\\varepsilon=V_R = 5.000\\ V$.\n\nStep 2: Resistance of the resistor ($R$) is calculated.\nUsing Ohm's law, the resistance of the resistor is:\n- $R=\\frac{V_R}{I_R}$.\nSince $I_R$ is current flowing through the resistor without the ammeter, that means From the above data, it is given that, $R = 10.00\\Omega$\n\nStep 3: Analyze the circuit with the ammeter.\nWhen the ammeter is in the circuit:\n1.

    "answer":"**Solution**\n\n**Step 1**\n**Part 1: (a, b, c, d)**\n(a) **Symmetry and the Electric Field**\nThe horizontal - electric - field components at the semicircle center cancel because each $dq$ charge distribution contains an opposite $dq$ charge element exactly across. Because the horizontal parts of both charge elements have matching strength and opposite direction they balance out completely.\nEach field component at the center only contributes through vertical projection. The composite electric - field vector lies only in the vertical $y$ - axis.\n(b) **Coordinate System and Integration Variable**\nA polar coordinate system is most appropriate, with the origin at the center of the semicircle. The angle $\\theta$, measured from the vertical axis, is the most convenient variable for integration because the semicircle is symmetric around this axis.

    "answer":"### Step 1\n1. **why do disks experience bearing stress?**\n   - Bearing stress occurs when a force is applied perpendicular to the contact - surface between two components. This is the stress developed due to the compression or crushing of one material against another.\n   - For disks A and B, the 140kN force is transferred through the disk layers. The load is applied vertically on their top surfaces, compressing at the interfaces where one disk rests on another (e.g., A on B, and B on C). The contact areas oppose this compressive force, and the stress produced is the bearing stress.\n   - **Explanation**:\n     - The bearing stress, $\\sigma_{bearing}$, is determined by $\\sigma_{bearing}=\\frac{F}{A}$, where $F$ is the force and $A$ is the contact area.\n\n### Step 2\n2. **why is disk C experiencing shear stress?**\n   - **Explanation**:\n     - Shear stress occurs when a force attempts to create sliding between layers of a material.\n     - In the case of disk C, the force exerted by the upper disks is transferred to be applied over its horizontal plane, at the interface with the ground, i.e., support. Compression is not the sole resistance but a horizontal component of resistance in the material.\n     - If the support or the disk cannot resist the shear force, then it undergoes shear failure. Shear stress, $\\tau$, is calculated as follows, $\\tau=\\frac{F}{A_{shear}}$, where $F$ is the force and $A_{shear}$ is the shear area, which in most cases would be the cross - sectional area perpendicular to the force.\n\n### Step 3\n3. **why is the failure mode different for disk C?**\n   - Disk C fails in shear because:\n     - 1. It is the last layer in the system, in direct contact with the fixed support (ground), the load must be transferred horizontally to the support to achieve equilibrium.\n     - 2. The vertical load from the disks above generates horizontal shear stresses at the interface between disk C and the ground.\n     - 3. If the material of disk C or the support cannot resist these shear stresses, shear failure occurs at the interface.\n   - In contrast, disks A and B are not directly subjected to horizontal force components; instead, they experience vertical compressive stresses.\n\n### Step 4\n4. **free body diagram explanation**\n   - **disk A**:\n     - Downward force is 140kN.\n     - Disk B reaction is upward compressive force, resulting in bearing stress at the interface with disk B.\n   - **disk B**:\n     - Downward force is 140kN from disk A.\n     - Reaction from disk C is upward compressive force, resulting in bearing stress at the interface with disk C.\n   - **disk C**:\n     - Downward force is 140kN.\n     - Shear force at its interface with the support to resist sliding, leads to shear failure because of horizontal force transfer.\n\n### Answer\nA and B will experience bearing stress because of the vertical compression from the applied 140 kN load. The disk C will experience shear stress at its interface with the support, which may cause shear failure due to horizontal force transfer.",

    "answer":"### Step 1\n**Explanation**:\nWe define the law of conservation of energy and Newton's second - law.\nThe law of conservation of energy tells us that the total energy of a body is equal at any point of its trajectory, so at any two points it is:\n$E_1 = E_2$\nThe total energy is equal to the sum of the kinetic energy, whose expression is\n$K=\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$\nwhere $m$ is the mass and $v$ is the velocity of the body, and the potential energy whose expression is\n$U = mgh$\nwhere $g$ is the acceleration of gravity and $h$ is the height at which the body is.\nNewton's second - law tells us that the sum of all the forces that affect a moving body is equal to the product of the mass and the acceleration of this:\n$\\sum F=ma$\n\n### Step 2\n**Explanation**:\nWe determine the velocity of the block at point C.\nThe energy at point A is equal to:\n$E_A=mgh_1+\\frac{1}{2}mv_0^{2}$\nand the energy at point C is equal to:\n$E_C=mgh_2+\\frac{1}{2}mv_{C}^{2}$\nWe apply energy conservation at these two points and we obtain:\n$E_A = E_C$\n$mgh_1+\\frac{1}{2}mv_0^{2}=mgh_2+\\frac{1}{2}mv_{C}^{2}$\nWe solve for the velocity at point C and we obtain:\n$gh_2+\\frac{1}{2}v_{C}^{2}=gh_1+\\frac{1}{2}v_0^{2}$\n$\\frac{1}{2}v_{C}^{2}=g(h_1 - h_2)+\\frac{1}{2}v_0^{2}$\n$v_{C}^{2}=2g(h_1 - h_2)+v_0^{2}$\n$v_{C}=\\sqrt{2g(h_1 - h_2)+v_0^{2}}=\\sqrt{2(10m\/s^{2})(17m - 1m)+(10m\/s)^{2}} = 20.5m\/s$\n\n### Step 3\n**Explanation**:\nWe determine the acceleration of the block during the trajectory from C to D.\nWhen the block starts its trajectory from C to D, it experiences a frictional force, which opposes its motion:\nWe are told that the frictional force is equal to the potential energy of the block when it is at a height of 0.5 m, so:\n$f_s = 0.5mg$\nWe apply Newton's second - law to the block at point C and we will have:\n$\\sum F=ma$\n$f_s=-ma$\n$0.5mg=-ma$\nThe negative sign is because the force opposes the motion of the block.\nWe solve for the acceleration of the block and we obtain:\n$a=-0.5g=-0.5(10m\/s^{2})=-5m\/s^{2}$\nIt is negative, which means that the block will start to decelerate.\n\n### Step 4\n**Explanation**:\nWe determine the distance traveled in the trajectory from C to D.\nWe take the velocity at C as the initial velocity of the trajectory, $v_C = v_i$. Since this is a uniformly accelerated motion, we can use the equation:\n$v_f^{2}=v_i^{2}+2ad$\nwhere $v_f$ is the final velocity and $d$ is the distance traveled.

The number of half - wavelengths in the string is equal to the number of anti - nodes, so $n = 3$.\n   - For a string fixed at both ends, the fundamental wavelength $\\lambda$ is determined by $L=n\\frac{\\lambda}{2}$, so $\\lambda=\\frac{2L}{n}$. Substituting $L = 0.306\\ m$ and $n = 3$, we get $\\lambda=\\frac{2\\times0.306}{3}=0.204\\ m$.\n2. **Calculating the Wave Speed (v)**:\n   - The wave speed $v$ in the string is related to the frequency $f$ and wavelength $\\lambda$ by the wave equation $v = f\\lambda$. Substituting $f = 408\\ Hz$ and $\\lambda=0.204\\ m$, we get $v=f\\lambda=408\\times0.204 = 83.232\\ m\/s$.\n3. **Relating Wave Speed to Tension (T)**:\n   - The wave speed $v$ in a string is also given by $v=\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}$, where $T$ is the tension in the string and $\\mu$ is the linear mass density. Rearranging for $T$, we get $T=\\mu v^{2}$. Substituting $\\mu = 3.94\\times 10^{-3}\\ kg\/m$ and $v = 83.232\\ m\/s$, we have $T=(3.94\\times 10^{-3})(83.232)^{2}\\approx27.1\\ N$.\n4. **Finding the Required Mass**:\n   - The tension $T$ in the string is provided by the weight of the suspended masses, $T = mg$ (where $g = 9.8\\ m\/s^{2}$). Rearranging for $m$, we get $m=\\frac{T}{g}$. Substituting $T\\approx27.1\\ N$ and $g = 9.8\\ m\/s^{2}$, we find $m=\\frac{27.1}{9.8}\\approx2.77\\ kg\\approx2.78\\ kg$.\n\nAnswer: The mass on each side of the string is $2.78\\ kg$ when a standing wave with four nodes and three anti - nodes occurs at $408\\ Hz$.",
