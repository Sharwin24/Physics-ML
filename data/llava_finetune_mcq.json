Massless springs with equal constants $k$ are attaching them as shown. Find the equation(s) of motion using Newton's 2nd law.\n<image>\nWhich of the following options is correct?\nA. Step 1 Given imp info -> Two discs with the same mass (m) and radius (r) $I_0$ is the moment of inertia of each disc with respect to its center of mass. Massless springs with a spring - constant of k connect them. On a plane that is inclined with angle $\\theta$ When under gravity, g Explanation: The discs' centers are shown by points P and Q. Our coordinate system is the distance along the incline. Refer to P and Q's locations as $x_1$ and $x_2$, respectively. The slope is going in a positive direction. Step 2 Each disc's forces: Component of gravity along an incline: $mg\\sin\\theta$ spring pressures resulting from interconnected springs Explanation: Normal force, which is perpendicular to the slope and has no effect on motion along it Rolling without sliding is caused by friction. In order to roll without slipping: Angular acceleration $\\alpha$ and linear acceleration a are connected by the formula $a = r\\alpha$. $\\tau=I_0\\alpha$ for a rolling disc, where $\\tau$ is the torque. Step 3 1. For disc P (upper disc, $x_1$): - Force equation: $m(\\frac{d^{2}x_1}{dt^{2}})=mg\\sin\\theta - k(x_1)+k(x_2 - x_1)$ 2. For disc Q (lower disc, $x_2$): - Force equation: $m(\\frac{d^{2}x_2}{dt^{2}})=mg\\sin\\theta - k(x_2 - x_1)$ 3. Due to rolling constraint: - $I_0\\frac{d^{2}\\varphi_1}{dt^{2}} = F_{r1}$ (for disc P) - $I_0\\frac{d^{2}\\varphi_2}{dt^{2}} = F_{r2}$ (for disc Q) Explanation: where $\\varphi_1$ and $\\varphi_2$ are angular displacements and $F_{r1}$, $F_{r2}$ are friction forces Therefore, the final equations of motion are: $\\left(m + \\frac{I_0}{r^{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{d^{2}x_1}{dt^{2}}\\right)=mg\\sin\\theta - k(x_1)+k(x_2 - x_1)$ $\\left(m+\\frac{I_0}{r^{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{d^{2}x_2}{dt^{2}}\\right)=mg\\sin\\theta - k(x_2 - x_1)$ These are coupled second - order differential equations describing the motion of the two - disc system.

To find the equations of motion for the two discs, we need to consider both the translational and rotational motion of each disc, as well as the forces exerted by the springs. Step 1: Define the variables and forces Let \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) be the positions of the centers of mass of discs P and Q, respectively, along the incline. The angle of the incline is \\( \\theta \\). The forces acting on each disc are: 1. Gravitational force components along the incline: \\( mg \\sin \\theta \\) for each disc. 2. Spring forces: For disc P, the spring force from the wall is \\( kx_1 \\) (assuming the unstretched length of the spring is zero for simplicity), and the spring force from the other spring is \\( k(x_2 - x_1 - l_0) \\), where \\( l_0 \\) is the natural length of the spring between the discs. For disc Q, the spring force from the other disc is \\( k(x_1 - x_2 + l_0) \\). Step 2: Write the translational equations of motion For disc P: \\[ m \\ddot{x}_1 = mg \\sin \\theta - kx_1 - k(x_2 - x_1 - l_0) = mg \\sin \\theta - kx_1 - kx_2 + kx_1 + kl_0 = mg \\sin \\theta - kx_2 + kl_0 \\] Simplifying, we get: \\[ m \\ddot{x}_1 = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_2 - x_1 - l_0) \\] \\[ m \\ddot{x}_1 = mg \\sin \\theta - kx_2 + kx_1 + kl_0 \\] \\[ m \\ddot{x}_1 = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_1 - x_2 + l_0) \\] For disc Q: \\[ m \\ddot{x}_2 = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_1 - x_2 + l_0) \\] Step 3: Write the rotational equations of motion The torque on each disc is due to the frictional force that causes rolling without slipping. The torque on disc P is: \\[ I_0 \\ddot{\\theta}_1 = r F_{\\text{fric},1} \\] Since the discs are rolling without slipping, \\( \\ddot{x}_1 = r \\ddot{\\theta}_1 \\), so: \\[ I_0 \\frac{\\ddot{x}_1}{r} = r F_{\\text{fric},1} \\] \\[ F_{\\text{fric},1} = \\frac{I_0 \\ddot{x}_1}{r^2} \\] Similarly, for disc Q: \\[ F_{\\text{fric},2} = \\frac{I_0 \\ddot{x}_2}{r^2} \\] The frictional forces are also the horizontal components of the normal reaction forces minus the gravitational component: \\[ F_{\\text{fric},1} = m g \\sin \\theta - k(x_2 - x_1 - l_0) - m \\ddot{x}_1 \\] \\[ F_{\\text{fric},2} = m g \\sin \\theta - k(x_1 - x_2 + l_0) - m \\ddot{x}_2 \\] Combining the translational and rotational equations, we get the final equations of motion: \\[ m \\ddot{x}_1 = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_1 - x_2 + l_0) \\] \\[ m \\ddot{x}_2 = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_1 - x_2 + l_0) \\] So the equations of motion are: \\[ \\boxed{m \\ddot{x}_1 = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_1 - x_2 + l_0)} \\] \\[ \\boxed{m \\ddot{x}_2 = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_1 - x_2 + l_0)} \\]\n\nC. To find the equations of motion for the two discs attached by massless springs on an inclined plane, we need to apply Newton's second law to both the translational and rotational motion of the discs. Let's denote the positions of the discs along the incline as \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) for disc \\( P \\) and disc \\( Q \\) respectively. The angle of the incline is \\( \\theta \\). Step 1: Translational Motion For disc \\( P \\), the forces acting are: - The component of gravity along the incline: \\( mg \\sin \\theta \\). - The spring force from the spring attached to the wall: \\( -kx_1 \\). - The spring force from the spring attached to disc \\( Q \\): \\( k(x_2 - x_1 - l_0) \\). The net force along the incline for disc \\( P \\) is: \\[ F_{\\text{net}, P} = mg \\sin \\theta - kx_1 + k(x_2 - x_1 - l_0) \\] \\[ F_{\\text{net}, P} = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_2 - 2x_1 - l_0) \\] By Newton's second law, the equation of motion for the translational motion of disc \\( P \\) is: \\[ m \\frac{d^2 x_1}{dt^2} = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_2 - 2x_1 - l_0) \\] For disc \\( Q \\), the forces acting are: - The component of gravity along the incline: \\( mg \\sin \\theta \\). - The spring force from the spring attached to disc \\( P \\): \\( -k(x_2 - x_1 - l_0) \\). The net force along the incline for disc \\( Q \\) is: \\[ F_{\\text{net}, Q} = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_2 - x_1 - l_0) \\] By Newton's second law, the equation of motion for the translational motion of disc \\( Q \\) is: \\[ m \\frac{d^2 x_2}{dt^2} = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_2 - x_1 - l_0) \\] Step 2: Rotational Motion For each disc, the torque due to the friction that causes rolling without slipping is given by: \\[ \\tau = I_0 \\alpha = I_0 \\frac{a}{r} \\] where \\( \\alpha \\) is the angular acceleration and \\( a \\) is the linear acceleration. The frictional force \\( f \\) provides the torque: \\[ \\tau = f r \\] \\[ f r = I_0 \\frac{a}{r} \\] \\[ f = \\frac{I_0}{r^2} a \\] The forces of friction and the net force provide the translational acceleration: \\[ m a = mg \\sin \\theta + \\text{(spring forces)} - f \\] \\[ m a = mg \\sin \\theta + \\text{(spring forces)} - \\frac{I_0}{r^2} a \\] \\[ \\left( m + \\frac{I_0}{r^2} \\right) a = mg \\sin \\theta + \\text{(spring forces)} \\] Final Equations of Motion Combining these, the final equations of motion are: \\[ \\left( m + \\frac{I_0}{r^2} \\right) \\frac{d^2 x_1}{dt^2} = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_2 - 2x_1 - l_0) \\] \\[ \\left( m + \\frac{I_0}{r^2} \\right) \\frac{d^2 x_2}{dt^2} = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_2 - x_1 - l_0) \\] The final form of the equations of motion is: \\[ \\boxed{\\left( m + \\frac{I_0}{r^2} \\right) \\frac{d^2 x_1}{dt^2} = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_2 - 2x_1 - l_0)} \\] \\[ \\left( m + \\frac{I_0}{r^2} \\right) \\frac{d^2 x_2}{dt^2} = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_2 - x_1 - l_0) \\]\n\nD. To find the equations of motion for the two discs rolling on the hill, we need to apply Newton's second law for both translational and rotational motion. We'll also consider the forces and torques acting on each disc. Step 1: Define the variables - Let \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) be the displacements of the centers of mass of discs \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) along the incline, respectively. - Let \\( \\theta_1 \\) and \\( \\theta_2 \\) be the angular displacements of discs \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\), respectively. Step 2: Write down the forces and torques For each disc, the forces acting are: 1. The component of gravity along the incline: \\( mg \\sin \\theta \\) 2. The spring force from the left spring \\( -k(x_1 - \\ell_0) \\) (for disc \\( P \\)) 3. The spring force from the right spring \\( k(x_2 - x_1 - \\ell_0) \\) (for disc \\( P \\)) 4. The spring force from the right spring \\( -k(x_2 - x_1 - \\ell_0) \\) (for disc \\( Q \\)) The net force along the incline for each disc can be written as: \\[ F_{1\\text{,net}} = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_1 - \\ell_0) + k(x_2 - x_1 - \\ell_0) \\] \\[ F_{2\\text{,net}} = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_2 - x_1 - \\ell_0) \\] Since the discs are rolling without slipping, the translational and rotational motions are related by \\( x_i = r \\theta_i \\) for \\( i = 1, 2 \\). Step 3: Apply Newton's second law for translation For disc \\( P \\): \\[ m \\ddot{x}_1 = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_1 - \\ell_0) + k(x_2 - x_1 - \\ell_0) \\] \\[ m \\ddot{x}_1 = mg \\sin \\theta - kx_1 + k\\ell_0 + kx_2 - kx_1 - k\\ell_0 \\] \\[ m \\ddot{x}_1 = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_2 - 2x_1) \\] For disc \\( Q \\): \\[ m \\ddot{x}_2 = mg \\sin \\theta - k(x_2 - x_1 - \\ell_0) \\] \\[ m \\ddot{x}_2 = mg \\sin \\theta - kx_2 + kx_1 + k\\ell_0 \\] \\[ m \\ddot{x}_2 = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_1 - x_2) \\] Step 4: Apply Newton's second law for rotation The torque for each disc due to the spring forces is: For disc \\( P \\): \\[ \\tau_1 = r \\left( -k(x_1 - \\ell_0) + k(x_2 - x_1 - \\ell_0) \\right) \\] \\[ I_0 \\ddot{\\theta}_1 = r \\left( -kx_1 + k\\ell_0 + kx_2 - kx_1 - k\\ell_0 \\right) \\] \\[ I_0 \\ddot{\\theta}_1 = r k (x_2 - 2x_1) \\] Since \\( x_1 = r \\theta_1 \\), \\( \\ddot{x}_1 = r \\ddot{\\theta}_1 \\), so \\( \\ddot{\\theta}_1 = \\frac{\\ddot{x}_1}{r} \\): \\[ I_0 \\frac{\\ddot{x}_1}{r} = r k (x_2 - 2x_1) \\] \\[ I_0 \\ddot{x}_1 = r^2 k (x_2 - 2x_1) \\] For disc \\( Q \\): \\[ \\tau_2 = r \\left( -k(x_2 - x_1 - \\ell_0) \\right) \\] \\[ I_0 \\ddot{\\theta}_2 = r \\left( -kx_2 + kx_1 + k\\ell_0 \\right) \\] \\[ I_0 \\frac{\\ddot{x}_2}{r} = r \\left( -kx_2 + kx_1 + k\\ell_0 \\right) \\] \\[ I_0 \\ddot{x}_2 = r^2 k (x_1 - x_2) \\] Step 5: Combine the equations We have the following system of equations: \\[ m \\ddot{x}_1 = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_2 - 2x_1) \\] \\[ m \\ddot{x}_2 = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_1 - x_2) \\] \\[ I_0 \\ddot{x}_1 = r^2 k (x_2 - 2x_1) \\] \\[ I_0 \\ddot{x}_2 = r^2 k (x_1 - x_2) \\] The final equations of motion are: \\[ \\boxed{m \\ddot{x}_1 = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_2 - 2x_1), \\quad m \\ddot{x}_2 = mg \\sin \\theta + k(x_1 - x_2), \\quad I_0 \\ddot{x}_1 = r^2 k (x_2 - 2x_1), \\quad I_0 \\ddot{x}_2 = r^2 k (x_1 - x_2)} \\]"

In addition to the original two Q charges, a charge 2Q is placed at point I. Does the magnitude of the electric force on the charge placed at point D increase, decrease or remain the same? Explain your reasoning and/or draw a vector - addition diagram as needed.\n<image>\nWhich of the following options is correct?\nA. The net force at point D remains zero due to symmetry.  \nB. The total electric force acting on the charge at D is $F_D=-\\frac{k\\times2Qq}{4L^{2}}\\hat{j}$ downward force.  \nC. The addition of 2Q at point I does not affect the force on D.  \nD. The force on D increases because 2Q adds an upward component."

We are given with the a - x graph for a simple harmonic motion, the gradient of the slope of the graph can be calculated by taking the slope of the given straight line passin from origin.\n\nB. To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Calculate the gradient of the acceleration versus displacement graph.**\\n2. **Deduce the frequency of the simple harmonic motion.**\\n3. **Determine the period of the motion.**\\n4. **Sketch the acceleration versus time graph.**\\n\\n### Step 1: Calculate the Gradient\\n\\nThe equation for simple harmonic motion (SHM) is given by:\\n\\n\\\\[ a = -\\\\omega^2 x \\\\]\\n\\nThis is a linear equation of the form \\\\( y = mx \\\\) where \\\\( m \\\\) is the gradient. Here, the gradient \\\\( m \\\\) is \\\\( -\\\\omega^2 \\\\).\\n\\nTo find the gradient, we need the values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( x \\\\) from the graph. Suppose the graph shows the following points:\\n\\n- At \\\\( x = 0 \\\\), \\\\( a = 0 \\\\)\\n- At \\\\( x = A \\\\), \\\\( a = -\\\\omega^2 A \\\\)\\n\\nAssume from the graph that at \\\\( x = 0.1 \\\\) m, \\\\( a = -4 \\\\) m/s\u00b2. Then,\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{Gradient} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta a}{\\\\Delta x} = \\\\frac{-4 - 0}{0.1 - 0} = \\\\frac{-4}{0.1} = -40 \\\\]\\n\\nSo, the gradient is \\\\( -40 \\\\).\\n\\n### Step 2: Deduce the Frequency\\n\\nFrom the gradient, we know:\\n\\n\\\\[ -\\\\omega^2 = -40 \\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\omega^2 = 40 \\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\omega = \\\\sqrt{40} = 2\\\\sqrt{10} \\\\]\\n\\nThe frequency \\\\( f \\\\) is given by:\\n\\n\\\\[ f = \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2\\\\pi} = \\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{10}}{2\\\\pi} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{10}}{\\\\pi} \\\\approx 0.997 \\\\text{ Hz} \\\\]\\n\\n### Step 3: Determine the Period\\n\\nThe period \\\\( T \\\\) is the inverse of the frequency:\\n\\n\\\\[ T = \\\\frac{1}{f} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{10}}{\\\\pi}} = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{\\\\sqrt{10}} \\\\approx 0.997 \\\\text{ s} \\\\]\\n\\n### Step 4: Sketch the Acceleration versus Time Graph\\n\\nThe acceleration \\\\( a \\\\) in SHM is given by:\\n\\n\\\\[ a = -\\\\omega^2 A \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) \\\\]\\n\\nAssume \\\\( A = 0.1 \\\\) m, then:\\n\\n\\\\[ a = -40 \\\\times 0.1 \\\\cos(2\\\\sqrt{10} t) = -4 \\\\cos(2\\\\sqrt{10} t) \\\\]\\n\\nWe need to sketch two complete cycles of this function.

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information step-by-step. Since the actual graph is not provided in the text, I'll proceed with a generic approach based on standard simple harmonic motion (SHM) relationships.\\n\\n### Step 1: Determine the Gradient\\nFor a particle undergoing simple harmonic motion, the relationship between acceleration \\\\(a\\\\) and displacement \\\\(x\\\\) is given by:\\n\\\\[ a = -\\\\omega^2 x \\\\]\\nwhere \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency.\\n\\nThe gradient of the graph \\\\(a\\\\) vs. \\\\(x\\\\) is equal to \\\\(-\\\\omega^2\\\\). To find the gradient, you would typically calculate:\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{Gradient} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta a}{\\\\Delta x} \\\\]\\n\\nAssuming the graph shows a linear relationship where the maximum acceleration \\\\(a_{\\\\text{max}}\\\\) corresponds to the maximum displacement \\\\(x_{\\\\text{max}}\\\\), the gradient can be calculated as:\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{Gradient} = -\\\\frac{a_{\\\\text{max}}}{x_{\\\\text{max}}} \\\\]\\n\\nLet's assume the graph shows \\\\(a_{\\\\text{max}} = -20 \\\\ \\\\text{m/s}^2\\\\) and \\\\(x_{\\\\text{max}} = 0.25 \\\\ \\\\text{m}\\\\):\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{Gradient} = -\\\\frac{-20}{0.25} = 80 \\\\ \\\\text{s}^{-2} \\\\]\\n\\nThus, the gradient is:\\n\\\\[ \\\\boxed{80} \\\\]\\n\\n### Step 2: Calculate the Frequency\\nThe gradient is \\\\(-\\\\omega^2\\\\), so:\\n\\\\[ \\\\omega^2 = 80 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ \\\\omega = \\\\sqrt{80} = 4\\\\sqrt{5} \\\\ \\\\text{rad/s} \\\\]\\n\\nThe frequency \\\\(f\\\\) is related to the angular frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) by:\\n\\\\[ f = \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2\\\\pi} \\\\]\\n\\\\[ f = \\\\frac{4\\\\sqrt{5}}{2\\\\pi} = \\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{5}}{\\\\pi} \\\\ \\\\text{Hz} \\\\]\\n\\nThus, the frequency is:\\n\\\\[ \\\\boxed{\\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{5}}{\\\\pi}} \\\\]\\n\\n### Step 3: Determine the Period\\nThe period \\\\(T\\\\) is the reciprocal of the frequency:\\n\\\\[ T = \\\\frac{1}{f} = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2\\\\sqrt{5}} \\\\ \\\\text{s} \\\\]\\n\\nThus, the period is:\\n\\\\[ \\\\boxed{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2\\\\sqrt{5}}} \\\\]\\n\\n### Step 4: Sketch the Graph of Acceleration vs Time\\nGiven that the displacement is zero and the velocity is positive at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), the acceleration at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) is also zero. The acceleration \\\\(a\\\\) varies sinusoidally with time. We can represent this as:\\n\\\\[ a(t) = -a_{\\\\text{max}} \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) \\\\]\\n\\nThe maximum acceleration \\\\(a_{\\\\text{max}} = 20 \\\\ \\\\text{m/s}^2\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega = 4\\\\sqrt{5} \\\\ \\\\text{rad/s}\\\\).\\n\\nThe time period \\\\(T = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2\\\\sqrt{5}} \\\\ \\\\text{s}\\\\) for one complete cycle.\\n\\nTo sketch the graph for at least two complete cycles, we need to extend the time axis from \\\\(0\\\\) to \\\\(2T\\\\). The amplitude of the acceleration will be \\\\(20 \\\\ \\\\text{m/s}^2\\\\), varying sinusoidally between \\\\(-20 \\\\ \\\\text{m/s}^2\\\\) and \\\\(20 \\\\ \\\\text{m/s}^2\\\\).\\n\\nHere's a rough sketch of the graph with labeled axes (note that this is a textual representation; you can use the provided grid to create the actual sketch):\\n\\n- \\\\(a\\\\) on the y-axis, ranging from \\\\(-20\\\\) to \\\\(20 \\\\ \\\\text{m/s}^2\\\\).\\n- \\\\(t\\\\) on the x-axis, ranging from \\\\(0\\\\) to \\\\(2T\\\\) where \\\\(2T = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{\\\\sqrt{5}} \\\\ \\\\text{s}\\\\).\\n\\nThe graph will look like a cosine wave starting from zero and cycling through two complete periods.\n\nD. To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:\\n\\n### Step 1: Calculate the Gradient of the Graph\\nThe graph shows the relationship between acceleration \\\\(a\\\\) and displacement \\\\(x\\\\) for a particle undergoing simple harmonic motion. The relationship is given by \\\\(a = -\\\\omega^2 x\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. The gradient of the graph is the coefficient of \\\\(x\\\\), which is \\\\(-\\\\omega^2\\\\).\\n\\nLet's assume from the graph that the maximum acceleration \\\\(a_{\\\\text{max}}\\\\) is 10 units and the maximum displacement \\\\(x_{\\\\text{max}}\\\\) is 2 units. The gradient of the graph is the slope of the line, which is:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{Gradient} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta a}{\\\\Delta x} = \\\\frac{-10 \\\\text{ units}}{2 \\\\text{ units}} = -5\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSo, the gradient is \\\\(-5\\\\). This means \\\\(-\\\\omega^2 = -5\\\\), so \\\\(\\\\omega^2 = 5\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega = \\\\sqrt{5}\\\\).\\n\\n### Step 2: Deducing the Frequency\\nThe frequency \\\\(f\\\\) is related to the angular frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) by the equation:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\omega = 2\\\\pi f\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSo,\\n\\n\\\\[\\nf = \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2\\\\pi} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}}{2\\\\pi}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n### Step 3: Calculate the Period\\nThe period \\\\(T\\\\) is the reciprocal of the frequency:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nT = \\\\frac{1}{f} = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\sqrt{5}}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n### Step 4: Sketch the Graph of Acceleration vs Time\\nThe acceleration \\\\(a\\\\) as a function of time \\\\(t\\\\) for simple harmonic motion is given by:\\n\\n\\\\[\\na(t) = -\\\\omega^2 A \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSince the displacement is zero and the velocity is positive at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), the particle is passing through the equilibrium position and moving to the positive direction. This means the cosine function will be zero at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and the sine function will be maximum. So, the acceleration will be:\\n\\n\\\\[\\na(t) = -\\\\omega^2 A \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) = -5 A \\\\cos(\\\\sqrt{5} t)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nWe can sketch the graph with two complete cycles. The period \\\\(T = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\sqrt{5}} \\\\approx 2.82\\\\) seconds. So, two complete cycles will be \\\\(2 \\\\times 2.82 = 5.64\\\\) seconds. We can choose the amplitude of the acceleration to be 10 units for simplicity.\\n\\nThe graph will look like a cosine wave that is inverted (negative cosine wave) with amplitude 10 units and period 2.82 seconds.\\n\\nThe final answers are:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{-5}\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}}{2\\\\pi}}\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\sqrt{5}}}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nAnd the sketch of the graph of acceleration against time is a negative cosine wave with amplitude 10 units and period 2.82 seconds."

        "value": "The correct answer is A because Step 1 a) The mass of bridge is $M = 2000\\ kg$ Mass of person is $m = 1000\\ kg$ Length of bridge is $L = 8\\ m$ Person is at a distance $r_1=7\\ m$ from hinge. Tension in rope is $T$ Rope is at a distance $5\\ m$ from hinge.

However, on an inclined plane:\\n- The normal force \\\\( \\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\text{N}} \\\\) balances the component of the gravitational force perpendicular to the bridge.\\n- The frictional force \\\\( \\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\text{friction}} \\\\) balances the component of the gravitational force parallel to the bridge.\\n\\nThus, you expect the following relationships:\\n\\\\[ \\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\text{N}} = \\\\mathbf{W}_{\\\\text{combined}} \\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\]\\n\\\\[ \\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\text{friction}} = \\\\mathbf{W}_{\\\\text{combined}} \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\]\\n\\nWhere \\\\( \\\\theta = 20^\\\\circ \\\\).\\n\\n**Combined Normal Force and Frictional Force**\\nSince the forces \\\\( \\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\text{N}} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\text{friction}} \\\\) together oppose and balance the components of the gravitational force on the inclined plane:\\n\\\\[ \\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\text{combined}} = \\\\sqrt{(\\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\text{N}})^2 + (\\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\text{friction}})^2} \\\\]\\n\\\\[ \\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\text{combined}} = \\\\mathbf{W}_{\\\\text{combined}} \\\\]\\n\\n### Part (b)\\n**Determine the Tension in the Cable**\\n\\nTo find the tension in the cable, analyze the torques about the pivot (castle end) with the given geometry.\\n1. **Identify Forces and Their Distances**:\\n   - \\\\( m_{\\\\text{combined}} = 1000 \\\\, \\\\text{kg} \\\\) at 7 meters from the pivot (1 meter from the end of the bridge).\\n   - \\\\( m_{\\\\text{bridge}} = 2000 \\\\, \\\\text{kg} \\\\) at the center of mass at 4 meters from the pivot.\\n   - Tension \\\\( T \\\\) applied at 5 meters from the pivot with a vertical distance of 12 meters.\\n   \\n2. **Torque equations about the pivot**:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\tau_{\\\\text{clockwise}} = \\\\tau_{\\\\text{counterclockwise}}\\n   \\\\]\\n   \\\\[\\n   (m_{\\\\text{combined}} \\\\cdot g \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot \\\\sin 20^\\\\circ) + (m_{\\\\text{bridge}} \\\\cdot g \\\\cdot 4 \\\\cdot \\\\sin 20^\\\\circ) = T \\\\cdot 5 \\\\cdot \\\\sin \\\\phi\\n   \\\\]\\n   where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is the angle between the tension and the horizontal (can be derived using the geometric relationship).\\n\\n3. **Calculate the vertical height for torque calculation**:\\n   Use the sine rule to find \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\):\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\sin \\\\phi = \\\\frac{12}{\\\\sqrt{5^2 + 12^2}} = \\\\frac{12}{13}\\n   \\\\]\\n4. **Substitute the values**:\\n   \\\\[\\n   T = \\\\frac{(1000 \\\\cdot 9.8 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot \\\\sin 20^\\\\circ) + (2000 \\\\cdot 9.8 \\\\cdot 4 \\\\cdot \\\\sin 20^\\\\circ)}{5 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{12}{13}}\\n   \\\\]\\n5. **Simplify the equation**:\\n   After calculations,\\n   \\\\[\\n   T = 6877.6 \\\\, \\\\text{N}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n### Part (c)\\n**Find the Horizontal and Vertical Force Components acting on the Bridge at the Castle End**\\n\\nFrom the sum of forces equilibrium:\\n\\\\[ \\n\\\\sum F_x = 0; \\\\quad \\\\sum F_y = 0 \\n\\\\]\\n\\n1. **Horizontal Force**:\\n\\\\[ F_{x} - T \\\\cos \\\\phi = 0 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ F_{x} = T \\\\cos \\\\phi \\\\]\\n\\\\[ F_{x} = 6877.6 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{5}{13} \\\\]\\n\\\\[ F_{x} = 2644.85 \\\\, \\\\text{N} \\\\]\\n\\n2. **Vertical Force**:\\n\\\\[ \\nF_{y} - m_{\\\\text{combined}} \\\\cdot g \\\\cdot \\\\sin 20^\\\\circ - m_{\\\\text{bridge}} \\\\cdot g \\\\cdot \\\\sin 20^\\\\circ + T \\\\sin \\\\phi = 0 \\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[ \\nF_{y} = (1000 \\\\cdot 9.8 \\\\cdot \\\\sin 20^\\\\circ) + (2000 \\\\cdot 9.8 \\\\cdot \\\\sin 20^\\\\circ) - 6877.6 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{12}{13}\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[ \\nF_{y} = 6288.6 \\\\, \\\\text{N} \\n\\\\]\\n\\n### Conclusion:\\n- **Horizontal Force** \\\\( F_{x} \\\\): 2644.85 N\\n- **Vertical Force** \\\\( F_{y} \\\\): 6288.6 N."

As such it has important application to the discussion of rotating atomic and nuclear particles. Consider a top of mass $m$ which, when viewed, is spinning in a counter - clockwise direction with angular momentum $\\vec{L}$. By convention, this is indicated by a vector length $\\vec{L}$ that points outward along the axis OA of the top as shown in figure - 1.\nIf the top is not upright, then the weight force $mg$ vertically down will provide a torque $\\vec{\\tau}$ about point O in the base of the top, which must tend to produce an increase in angular momentum in the direction of that torque. This direction will always be perpendicular to the direction of $\\vec{L}$; hence this torque can never change the magnitude of $\\vec{L}$, but only it direction. It is seen that $\\vec{L}$, and hence the axis of the top, will precess around in a circle about the vertical line $z$ - axis. \n(a) the centre of mass of the top is seen to be at a distance $r$ from the vertical. Consequently the torque is of magnitude: $\\tau=mgr$ This is, then, the magnitude of the rate of change of angular momentum $\\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt}$.\n(b) the angular momentum is depicted as precessing about the vertical with angular velocity $\\omega'=\\frac{d\\varphi}{dt}=\\frac{\\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt}\\sin\\theta}{L\\sin\\theta}=\\frac{\\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt}}{L}=\\frac{mgr}{L}=\\frac{mgh}{L}=\\frac{mgh}{I\\omega}$, where $h$ is the distance from the centre of mass to the base of the top, and $r = h\\sin\\theta$.\nFor the top shown, is made of ring of mass $m$ radius $R$ with three identical rods each of mass $m$ and length $R$ as shown in figure - 3.

This energy is still not enough to go over the fission barrier as the activation energy $E_A = 6.5\\ MeV$ while $S_n(^{239}U)=4.8\\ MeV$, however, fission may proceed through tunnel effect. The plot below represents typical potential energy $E$ as a function of the deformation parameter $dr$. It is mainly composed of 2 branches: $V_1$ represents the deformation energy when the $^{239}U$ shape - assumed to be spherical - gets deformed towards an ellipsoid whose long axis is $2(R(A)+dr)$, while $V_2$ represents the Coulomb energy for 2 daughter nuclei whose centers are separated by a distance $d = 2\\times dr>2R(A/2)$, where $R(A/2)$ is the radius of these daughter nuclei.\na) Considering that \" $E = 0$\" corresponds to the potential energy when $dr = 0$, draw, on the plot, horizontal lines corresponding to a) the activation energy $E_A$ and b) the excitation energy $E^*$ for neutron kinetic energy of $1\\ MeV$. Label the 2 points corresponding to $E(dr)=E^*$ as $dr_1$ and $dr_2$ (with $dr_1<dr_2$).\nb) Estimation of $dr_1$: The deformation potential energy for small deformations writes\n$\\Delta E=\\left(\\frac{2}{5}a_vA^{2/3}-\\frac{1}{5}a_c\\frac{Z^2}{A^{1/3}}\\right)\\varepsilon^2$\nwith $\\varepsilon = dr/R(A)$ and $a_v = 16.8\\ MeV$ and $a_c = 0.72\\ MeV$.

The neutron energy is sufficient to overcome the fission barrier directly.\n\nB. Solution by a Physics expert\n\nStep 1\n\nTheory:\nIn this question, the fission process of $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$ by a neutron with kinetic energy $(E_n = 1.0\\mathrm{MeV})$ is investigated. After the interaction with the neutron, the nucleus is deformed with a deformation parameter $(d_r)$. The potential energy as a function of $(d_r)$ features two regions: the interior region controlled by nuclear forces and the exterior region where the situation is defined by Coulomb repulsion.\nFirst, to calculate fission, the system must provide energy equal to the activation energy $(E_a)$. When the energy is sufficient, the nucleus can overcome the potential - energy barrier and fission. If the neutron energy $(E_n)$ is low and cannot overcome $(E_a)$, then through tunneling effect (which is quantum - mechanical effect), the system is able to penetrate this barrier.\n\n(a) Identifying $(E = 0)$ and points corresponding to $(E(d_r)=E_a)$ and $(E(d_r)=E_n)$:\n1. Definitions:\n- $(E = 0)$: This corresponds to the initial state, where the nucleus has no deformation $(d_r = 0)$.\n- $(E(d_r)=E_a)$: This corresponds to the activation energy barrier $(E_a = 6.5\\mathrm{MeV})$.\n- $(E(d_r)=E_n)$: This corresponds to the neutron kinetic energy $(E_n = 1.0\\mathrm{MeV})$.\n2. From the graph:\nAt $(d_{r1})$, the energy $(E(d_{r1}))$ is approximately equal to $(E_a)$.\nAt $(d_{r2})$, the energy $(E(d_{r2}))$ is approximately equal to $(E_n)$.\n$(d_{r1})$ and $(d_{r2})$ are the points in the graph where $(E(d_r)=E_a)$ and $(E(d_r)=E_n)$ respectively.\n\nStep 2\n\n(b) Estimation of $(d_{r1})$:\nThe deformation potential energy for small deformations $(E(d_r))$ is given as:\n$\\Delta E=\\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2}{4I}\\right)A^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}\\frac{d_r^2}{R_0^2}\\right)$\n$(A = 238)$, $(R_0 = 1.2A^{\\frac{1}{3}})$\n$\\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2}{4I}(A)\\right)=0.72\\mathrm{MeV}$\nFirst, calculate $(R(A))$:\n$R(A)=1.2A^{\\frac{1}{3}} = 1.2(238)^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\approx1.2(6.22)=7.46\\mathrm{fm}$\nNext, substitute into $(\\Delta E)$:\n$\\Delta E=\\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2}{4I}\\right)(238)^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}\\frac{d_{r1}^2}{R^2}\\right)$\nRearrange to solve for $(d_{r1})$ and estimate $(d_{r1})$:\n$d_{r1}=0.72R(A)=0.72\\times7.46 = 5.37\\mathrm{fm}$\n\nFinal Answer (b): $(d_{r1}=5.37\\mathrm{fm})$\n\nStep 3\n\n(c) Estimation of $(d_{r2})$:\nThe Q - value for fission is:\n$Q = 0.259A^{\\frac{1}{3}}-4.478A^{-\\frac{1}{3}}$\nSubstitute $(A = 238)$:\n$Q = 0.259(238)^{\\frac{1}{3}}-4.478(238)^{-\\frac{1}{3}}$\nCalculate $(A^{\\frac{1}{3}})$ and $(A^{-\\frac{1}{3}})$:\n$A^{\\frac{1}{3}}=(238)^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\approx6.22$, $A^{-\\frac{1}{3}}=(238)^{-\\frac{1}{3}}\\approx\\frac{1}{6.22}=0.161$\nSubstitute:\n$Q = 0.259(6.22)-4.478(0.161)$\n$Q\\approx10.02 - 0.72=9.3\\mathrm{MeV}$\n$\\left[\\Delta E(d_r)=\\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2}{4I}\\right)\\frac{d_r^2}{R^2}\\right]$\n$d_{r2}=\\sqrt{\\frac{4I\\Delta E(d_r)}{\\hbar^2}R^2}$\nSubstitute:\n$(Z = 92)$, $(E_a = 16.5\\mathrm{MeV})$, $(\\rho = 0.0073)$, $(\\Delta E(d_r)=Q\\approx9.3\\mathrm{MeV})$, $(A = 238)$\n$d_{r2}=\\sqrt{\\frac{9.3\\times4I}{\\hbar^2}R^2}$\nCalculate step - by - step:\n$(92)^2 = 8464$, $\\frac{8464\\times16.5}{238}=590.656$, $590.656\\times0.0073\\approx139.656$\n$d_{r2}=\\sqrt{\\frac{139.656}{\\hbar^2}R^2}\\approx17.6\\mathrm{fm}$\nFinal Answer (c): $(d_{r2}=17.6\\mathrm{fm})$\n\nStep 4\n\n(d) Probability of transmission (tunneling):\nThe probability of tunneling through a square well is:\n$T = e^{-2\\kappa L}$\nwhere $\\kappa=\\sqrt{\\frac{2m(U - E)}{\\hbar^2}}$\nSubstitute known values:\n$(m\\approx931.5\\frac{\\mathrm{MeV}}{c^2})$, $(U = E_a = 6.5\\mathrm{MeV})$, $(E = E_n = 1.0\\mathrm{MeV})$, $(L=d_{r2}-d_{r1}=17.6 - 5.37 = 12.23\\mathrm{fm})$\nFirst, calculate $(U - E)$:\n$U - E=6.5 - 1.0 = 5.5\\mathrm{MeV}$\nNext, calculate $(\\kappa)$:\n$\\kappa=\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\times931.5\\times5.5}{\\hbar^2}}\\approx\\sqrt{\\frac{10246.5}{\\hbar^2}}\\approx0.265 = 0.513\\mathrm{fm}^{-1}$\nNow, calculate $(T)$:\n$T = e^{-2\\times0.513\\times12.23}=e^{-12.5}\\approx3.5\\times10^{-6}$\nFinal Answer (d): $(T\\approx3.5\\times10^{-6})$\n\n(e) Average time for fission:\nThe average time is:\n$\\tau=\\frac{1}{fT}$\nwhere $(f = 10^{21}\\mathrm{s}^{-1})$ is the number of trials per second.\nSubstitute:\n$\\tau=\\frac{1}{10^{21}\\times3.5\\times10^{-6}}$\n$\\tau\\approx\\frac{1}{3.5\\times10^{15}}\\approx2.86\\times10^{-16}\\mathrm{s}$\nFinal Answer (e): $(\\tau\\approx2.86\\times10^{-16}\\mathrm{s})$\n\nAnswer\n\nSummary of Final Answers:\n(a) $(E_a)$ and $(E_n)$ correspond to $(d_{r1})$ and $(d_{r2})$\nPotential Energy as a Function of Deformation Parameter\n\n(b) $(d_{r1}=5.37\\mathrm{fm})$\n(c) $(d_{r2}=17.6\\mathrm{fm})$\n(d) $(T\\approx3.5\\times10^{-6})$\n(e) $(\\tau\\approx2.86\\times10^{-16}\\mathrm{s})$\n![](images/2b591fa39cc03551a621f6175edf742beac747cfdd7531c99b9e6bd494a095e2.jpg)\n![](images/f07558f49c1ad8c44335df09414cb15333fb8691b72fe6d1adc4e86524409041.jpg)\n\nC.

Center of Mass $G$\\n\\nTo find the coordinates of the center of mass $G$, we can exploit the symmetry of the shape and integrate over the area.\\n\\n### 1.1 Calculate the mass $m$\\nThe mass of the full circle of radius $R$ is:\\n\\\\[\\nm_{full} = \\\\rho \\\\pi R^2\\n\\\\]\\nwhere $\\\\rho$ is the mass per unit area. The mass $m$ of the circular sector with angle $\\\\frac{3\\\\pi}{2}$ is:\\n\\\\[\\nm = \\\\frac{3}{4} \\\\rho \\\\pi R^2 = \\\\frac{3}{4} m_{full}\\n\\\\]\\nHence:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\rho = \\\\frac{4m}{3\\\\pi R^2}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n### 1.2 Find the center of mass $G$\\nThe center of mass coordinates $(x_G, y_G)$ of the circular sector can be calculated as follows:\\nThe area of the sector is:\\n\\\\[\\nA = \\\\frac{3}{4} \\\\pi R^2\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThe $y$-coordinate of the center of mass:\\n\\\\[\\ny_G = \\\\frac{\\\\int y \\\\, dA}{A}\\n\\\\]\\nWith polar coordinates, $y = r \\\\sin \\\\theta$ and $dA = r \\\\, dr \\\\, d\\\\theta$, the integral becomes:\\n\\\\[\\ny_G = \\\\frac{1}{A} \\\\int_{0}^{R} \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\frac{3\\\\pi}{2}} r \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\cdot r \\\\, dr \\\\, d\\\\theta\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\ny_G = \\\\frac{1}{A} \\\\int_{0}^{R} r^2 \\\\, dr \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\frac{3\\\\pi}{2}} \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\, d\\\\theta\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\ny_G = \\\\frac{1}{A} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{r^3}{3} \\\\right]_0^R \\\\left[ -\\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\right]_0^{\\\\frac{3\\\\pi}{2}} \\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\ny_G = \\\\frac{1}{A} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{R^3}{3} \\\\cdot (-(-1 - (-1))) \\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\ny_G = \\\\frac{4}{3\\\\pi R^2} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{R^3}{3} \\\\cdot 2 = \\\\frac{8R}{9\\\\pi}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nBy symmetry, $x_G = 0$. Therefore, the center of mass $G$ is:\\n\\\\[\\nG \\\\left( 0, \\\\frac{8R}{9\\\\pi} \\\\right)\\n\\\\]\\n\\n## 2. Inertia Tensor Matrix $(I)_O$ at Point $O$\\n\\nThe moment of inertia tensor at the origin $O$ can be calculated as:\\n\\\\[\\n(I)_O = \\\\begin{bmatrix}\\nI_{xx} & I_{xy} & I_{xz} \\\\\\\\\\nI_{xy} & I_{yy} & I_{yz} \\\\\\\\\\nI_{xz} & I_{yz} & I_{zz}\\n\\\\end{bmatrix}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n### 2.1 Calculate the individual components\\n\\n#### $I_{xx}$:\\n\\\\[\\nI_{xx} = \\\\int_S \\\\rho (y^2 + z^2) \\\\, dA\\n\\\\]\\nAs the plate is in the $xy$-plane, $z = 0$, hence:\\n\\\\[\\nI_{xx} = \\\\int_S \\\\rho y^2 \\\\, dA\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\nI_{xx} = \\\\rho \\\\int_{0}^{R} \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\frac{3\\\\pi}{2}} r^3 \\\\sin^2 \\\\theta \\\\, d\\\\theta \\\\, dr\\n\\\\]\\nUsing trigonometric identities, the integral can be solved to give:\\n\\\\[\\nI_{xx} = \\\\frac{3}{4} m R^2\\n\\\\]\\n\\n#### $I_{yy}$:\\nSimilarly,\\n\\\\[\\nI_{yy} = \\\\int_S \\\\rho (x^2 + z^2) \\\\, dA = \\\\rho \\\\int_{0}^{R} \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\frac{3\\\\pi}{2}} r^3 \\\\cos^2 \\\\theta \\\\, d\\\\theta \\\\, dr = \\\\frac{3}{4} m R^2\\n\\\\]\\n\\n#### $I_{xy}$:\\n\\\\[\\nI_{xy} = -\\\\int_S \\\\rho x y \\\\, dA = - \\\\rho \\\\int_{0}^{R} \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\frac{3\\\\pi}{2}} r^3 \\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\, d\\\\theta \\\\, dr = 0 \\\\quad \\\\text{(due to symmetry)}\\n\\\\]\\nSince the shape's symmetry implies equal distribution around $x$ and $y$ axes.\\n\\n#### $I_{zz}$:\\n\\\\[\\nI_{zz} = \\\\int_S \\\\rho (x^2 + y^2) \\\\, dA = \\\\rho \\\\int_S \\\\rho r^3 \\\\, dr d\\\\theta \\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\nI_{zz} = \\\\frac{3}{2} m R^2\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThus, the Inertia Tensor Matrix at $O$ is:\\n\\\\[\\n(I)_O = \\\\begin{bmatrix}\\n\\\\frac{3}{4} m R^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\ \\n0 & \\\\frac{3}{4} m R^2 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n0 & 0 & \\\\frac{3}{2} m R^2 \\n\\\\end{bmatrix}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n## 3. Inertia Tensor Matrix $(I)_G$ at Point $G$\\nUsing the Parallel Axis Theorem:\\n\\\\[\\n(I)_G = (I)_O - m (r_{G}^2 \\\\mathbb{I} - \\\\vec{r}_G \\\\vec{r}_G^T)\\n\\\\]\\nwhere $\\\\vec{r}_G = (0, \\\\frac{8R}{9\\\\pi}, 0)$\\n\\nCalculate $r_{G}^2 = (\\\\frac{8R}{9\\\\pi})^2$, apply parallel axis theorem.\\n\\n## 4. Inertia Tensor Matrix at Point $O$, Referring to Its Main Axes of Inertia\\nGiven symmetry, output from tensor is the one mentioned previously. Hence, main axes of inertia are aligned with the principal axes of $x, y, z$. Thus the inertia tensor remains:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n(I)_O = \\\\begin{bmatrix}\\n\\\\frac{3}{4} m R^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\ \\n0 & \\\\frac{3}{4} m R^2 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n0 & 0 & \\\\frac{3}{2} m R^2 \\n\\\\end{bmatrix}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThis matrix represents the solution eigen-axes as the principal axes.\n\nC. To solve the problem, we need to go through the following steps:\\n\\n### Step 1: Coordinates of the Center of Mass, \\\\( G \\\\)\\n\\nThe center of mass of a sector of a circle with angle \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) can be found using the formulas for the center of mass of a sector. For a sector with angle \\\\(\\\\theta = \\\\frac{3\\\\pi}{2}\\\\), the center of mass is given by:\\n\\\\[\\nx_{\\\\text{cm}} = R \\\\frac{2 \\\\sin(\\\\theta/2)}{\\\\theta} = R \\\\frac{2 \\\\sin(\\\\frac{3\\\\pi}{4})}{\\\\frac{3\\\\pi}{2}} = R \\\\frac{2 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{2}}{\\\\frac{3\\\\pi}{2}} = R \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{\\\\frac{3\\\\pi}{2}} = R \\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{2}}{3\\\\pi}\\n\\\\]\\nSince the sector is symmetric about the y-axis, \\\\( y_{\\\\text{cm}} = 0 \\\\).\\n\\nThus, the coordinates of the center of mass are:\\n\\\\[\\nG = \\\\left( -\\\\frac{2R\\\\sqrt{2}}{3\\\\pi}, 0 \\\\right)\\n\\\\]\\n\\n### Step 2: Inertia Tensor Matrix \\\\((I)_0\\\\) at Point \\\\( O \\\\)\\n\\nThe moment of inertia of a sector of a circle about its center \\\\( O \\\\) can be calculated using the standard formulas for moments of inertia. For a sector with angle \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\), the moments of inertia about the \\\\(x\\\\)-axis and \\\\(y\\\\)-axis are:\\n\\\\[\\nI_{xx} = \\\\frac{m R^2}{2} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{4 \\\\sin^2(\\\\theta/2)}{3\\\\theta}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{m R^2}{2} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{4 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{2}}{3\\\\cdot \\\\frac{3\\\\pi}{2}}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{m R^2}{2} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{4}{9\\\\pi}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{m R^2}{2} \\\\left(\\\\frac{9\\\\pi - 4}{9\\\\pi}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{18\\\\pi}\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\nI_{yy} = \\\\frac{m R^2}{2} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{4 \\\\sin^2(\\\\theta/2)}{3\\\\theta}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{18\\\\pi}\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\nI_{zz} = I_{xx} + I_{yy} = \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{9\\\\pi}\\n\\\\]\\nSince the plate is symmetric about the z-axis, the product of inertia terms are zero:\\n\\\\[\\nJ_{xy} = J_{xz} = J_{yz} = 0\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThus, the inertia tensor matrix at point \\\\( O \\\\) is:\\n\\\\[\\n(I)_0 = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{18\\\\pi} & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{18\\\\pi} & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{9\\\\pi} \\\\end{bmatrix}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n### Step 3: Inertia Tensor Matrix \\\\((I)_G\\\\) at Point \\\\( G \\\\)\\n\\nUsing the parallel axis theorem, we shift the inertia tensor to the center of mass \\\\( G \\\\). The distance from \\\\( O \\\\) to \\\\( G \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\frac{2R\\\\sqrt{2}}{3\\\\pi} \\\\) along the \\\\( x \\\\)-axis. The parallel axis theorem gives:\\n\\\\[\\nI_{xx,G} = I_{xx,O} - m \\\\left( \\\\frac{2R\\\\sqrt{2}}{3\\\\pi} \\\\right)^2 = \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{18\\\\pi} - m \\\\left( \\\\frac{2R\\\\sqrt{2}}{3\\\\pi} \\\\right)^2 = \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{18\\\\pi} - m \\\\frac{8R^2}{9\\\\pi^2} = \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4) \\\\pi - 16R^2}{18\\\\pi^2}\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\nI_{yy,G} = I_{yy,O} + m \\\\left( \\\\frac{2R\\\\sqrt{2}}{3\\\\pi} \\\\right)^2 = \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{18\\\\pi} + m \\\\frac{8R^2}{9\\\\pi^2} = \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4) \\\\pi + 16R^2}{18\\\\pi^2}\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\nI_{zz,G} = I_{zz,O} = \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{9\\\\pi}\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\nJ_{xy,G} = J_{xz,G} = J_{yz,G} = 0\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThus, the inertia tensor matrix at point \\\\( G \\\\) is:\\n\\\\[\\n(I)_G = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4) \\\\pi - 16R^2}{18\\\\pi^2} & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4) \\\\pi + 16R^2}{18\\\\pi^2} & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{9\\\\pi} \\\\end{bmatrix}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n### Step 4: Inertia Tensor Matrix at Point \\\\( O \\\\), Referring to Its Main Axes of Inertia\\n\\nThe main axes of inertia at point \\\\( O \\\\) are the \\\\( x \\\\)-axis, \\\\( y \\\\)-axis, and \\\\( z \\\\)-axis, since the inertia tensor at \\\\( O \\\\) is already diagonal. Thus, the inertia tensor matrix at point \\\\( O \\\\) in its main axes is:\\n\\\\[\\n(I) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{18\\\\pi} & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{18\\\\pi} & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{9\\\\pi} \\\\end{bmatrix}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThus, the final answer is:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{18\\\\pi} & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{18\\\\pi} & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\frac{m R^2 (9\\\\pi - 4)}{9\\\\pi} \\\\end{bmatrix}}\\n\\\\]\n\nD.

The weight of the leg below the knee is $48.0\\ N$, with the center of gravity located below the knee joint. The leg is being held in this position because of the force $\\vec{M}$ applied by the quadriceps muscle, which is attached $0.100\\ m$ below the knee joint (see the drawing). Obtain the magnitude of $\\vec{M}$.\nKnee joint is marked. The force $\\vec{M}$ makes an angle of $25.0^{\\circ}$ with the line of action related to the leg - muscle connection. The distance from the knee - joint to the point of muscle attachment is $0.100\\ m$, and the distance from the knee - joint to the center of gravity ($cg$) of the leg below the knee is $0.150\\ m$. The leg makes an angle of $30.0^{\\circ}$ with the horizontal.\nWe will use the principle of torque equilibrium. The sum of the torques about the knee - joint is zero, $\\sum\\tau = 0$.\nThe weight of the leg $W = 48.0\\ N$ creates a clock - wise torque $\\tau_{W}$, and the force $\\vec{M}$ creates a counter - clockwise torque $\\tau_{M}$.\nThe torque due to a force $\\vec{F}$ is given by $\\tau=rF\\sin\\theta$, where $r$ is the distance from the pivot point to the point of application of the force, $F$ is the magnitude of the force, and $\\theta$ is the angle between the position vector $\\vec{r}$ (from the pivot point to the point of application of the force) and the force vector $\\vec{F}$.\nFor the weight of the leg, $r_{W}=0.150\\ m$, $\\theta_{W}=30.0^{\\circ}$, and $F = W = 48.0\\ N$. So the torque due to the weight of the leg is $\\tau_{W}=r_{W}W\\sin\\theta_{W}$.\nFor the force $\\vec{M}$, $r_{M}=0.100\\ m$, $\\theta_{M}=(25.0^{\\circ}+ 30.0^{\\circ})=55.0^{\\circ}$. So the torque due to the force $\\vec{M}$ is $\\tau_{M}=r_{M}M\\sin\\theta_{M}$.\nSince the leg is in rotational equilibrium, $\\sum\\tau=\\tau_{M}-\\tau_{W}=0$, which means $r_{M}M\\sin\\theta_{M}=r_{W}W\\sin\\theta_{W}$.\nWe want to solve for $M$. Rearranging the equation gives:\n$$ M=\\frac{r_{W}W\\sin\\theta_{W}}{r_{M}\\sin\\theta_{M}} $$\nSubstituting the given values: $r_{W} = 0.150\\ m$, $W = 48.0\\ N$, $\\theta_{W}=30.0^{\\circ}$, $r_{M}=0.100\\ m$, and $\\theta_{M}=55.0^{\\circ}$\n$$ M=\\frac{0.150\\times48.0\\times\\sin(30.0^{\\circ})}{0.100\\times\\sin(55.0^{\\circ})} $$\n$$ M=\\frac{0.150\\times48.0\\times0.5}{0.100\\times0.819} $$\n$$ M=\\frac{3.6}{0.0819}\\approx43.96\\ N $$\nNumber: $44.0$ (rounded to one decimal place)\nUnits: $N$\n<image>\nWhich of the following options is correct?\nA.
